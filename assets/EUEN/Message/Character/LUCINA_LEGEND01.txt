MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_HOME1: I'm heading out on patrol. I heard that\nGrima may have been spotted in this\nworld, so we must remain vigilant.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_HOME2: It's hard to feel at ease when wielding\na weapon I'm not used to. I suppose\nthe only remedy is more training...
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_HOME3: You have bags under your eyes.\nHave you not been resting well? Or\nwere you up late reading again?
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_HOME4: It requires a keen eye to hit a distant\ntarget. My eyesight happens to be\nquite finely honed.$k$pI often keep an eye on you as well.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_HOME5: You...you wish to inquire regarding\nthis...shattered training dummy? It\nwas...um...beyond my control...$k$pI was practicing speed nocking, and I\nbecame so focused that...well...as\nyou can see...
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_FRIEND: My name is Lucina. It's quite nice to\nsee you, $Nu.$k$pYou're right—this isn't my usual\noutfit. Good eye!
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_LEVEL1: I feel as if I could shoot a star out\nof the sky!
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_LEVEL2: Not bad...but I'll continue to\nimprove with more experience.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_LEVEL3: My apologies... Perhaps I'm just\nbetter with a sword.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_SKILL: This thrill is second only to slipping\ninto a new outfit.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_JOIN: I am Lucina, daughter of the Exalt\nChrom of the Halidom of Ylisse. I\ncome wielding a legendary bow.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_STRONGEST: Oh, $Nu!$k$pM-my apologies. I must seem so\nflustered right now... Was my visage\ntruly contorted in such a manner?$k$pI heard the fell dragon Grima may\nhave appeared in this world, as well...$k$pThe very same that led my own world\nto ruin. I was not strong enough back\nthen...$k$pI was unable to protect my own\nparents...my own precious friends\nand allies... I could protect no one.$k$pWhen I think that the same awful fate\nmay befall another world, I suppose\nI cannot help but scowl.$k$pEven the aid of a legendary weapon\nsuch as this does little to console me.\nBut, $Nu...$k$pThank you. You are kind to offer your\nassistance. I will never turn it down.$k$pI don't want to lose anyone so special\nto me ever again. And with your aid,\nperhaps I won't.

MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_VOICE12: After the things I have witnessed, I am not so easily startled.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_VOICE13: So, what do you think of my outfit?
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_VOICE14: Could it be that Grima exists in this world as well? That means...
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_VOICE15: Thanks to my father and the strength of our bond...my future was saved.
MID_LUCINA_LEGEND01_VOICE16: Fell dragon Grima... I swear upon my life, I will defeat you once and for all.
