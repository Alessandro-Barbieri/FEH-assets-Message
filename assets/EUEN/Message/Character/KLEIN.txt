MID_KLEIN_HOME1: Some call me the Archer General, but I\nfeel I can serve a kingdom better as\nan administrator than a general.
MID_KLEIN_HOME2: I see myself clearly, I think. I don't\nhave my parents' battle acumen. So I\nmake myself useful in other ways.
MID_KLEIN_HOME3: I'm also glad to handle some tasks\nfor you at the castle. Your burden is\nheavy. I'm glad to bear some of it.
MID_KLEIN_HOME4: I have a younger sister named Clarine.\nShe's nice, once you get to know her.$k$pClarine does live a bit too much in\nher own world though. Still, she's\nvery sweet in her own way.
MID_KLEIN_HOME5: I learned all of the etiquette needed\nat court in my own world. I hope\nthat some of it applies here.
MID_KLEIN_FRIEND: Well, greetings. I've come to say\nhello on behalf of your friend\n$Nf.
MID_KLEIN_LEVEL1: What a surprise! This is\nunusual for me.
MID_KLEIN_LEVEL2: It seems I'm growing at a\nrespectable pace.
MID_KLEIN_LEVEL3: Hmm. A reminder of my\nshortcomings.
MID_KLEIN_SKILL: Thank you. I'll do my best to live\nup to your expectations.
MID_KLEIN_JOIN: I am Klein, son of Count Reglay\nof Etruria. I'll be happy to\naccompany you!
MID_KLEIN_STRONGEST: Thanks to my noble birth, I've had\nthe fortune to meet many different\npeople during my life.$k$pI feel it's made me a good\njudge of character.$k$pFor example, those who talk\nthe talk rarely walk the walk.\nAnd they often run away.$k$pThen there are those who hardly\nsay a word and never boast,\nyet are quick to help others.$k$pSuch a person saved me when I\nwas a child. That's how I know\nthat I can trust you fully.$k$pAnd I devote my skills to your\ncause and will continue to do so.\nIt's an honor to serve you.

MID_KLEIN_VOICE14: Let us stay vigilant, for your sake and that of your family.
MID_KLEIN_VOICE15: They call me the Archer General, for what that's worth.
MID_KLEIN_VOICE16: Wouldn't going with the flow be bliss? But in time, what becomes of such a life?
