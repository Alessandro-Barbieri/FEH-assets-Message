MID_KAGEROU_HOME1: The royals of this realm seem to\nemploy no retainers. I find that...\ninteresting.$k$pBoth Hoshido and Nohr use them\nto safeguard royals. Are they that\nable to defend themselves here?
MID_KAGEROU_HOME2: My liege is Lord Ryoma, a noble\nleader, strong in spirit and body.\nIt is my honor to serve him.
MID_KAGEROU_HOME3: You are so dutiful. I would be glad\nto prepare a tea ceremony for you.\nYou'll find it relaxing.$k$pI prefer to use green tea, though\nmine tends to be bitter. It goes\nwith sweet treats nicely, however.
MID_KAGEROU_HOME4: You're also new here. You'll want to\nremember everything from these\ndays when all seems unusual.$k$pI find that keeping a diary helps one\npreserve memories—especially if\nyou draw pictures too.
MID_KAGEROU_HOME5: I draw pictures of the local scenery in\nmy diary. I'm afraid that they look a\nbit hellish. It's...just how I draw.
MID_KAGEROU_FRIEND: I've come on a mission from\n$Nf.$k$pBasically, it's to say hello. That done,\nI'll be on my way.
MID_KAGEROU_LEVEL1: A ninja shows no emotion. Not\neven joy.
MID_KAGEROU_LEVEL2: Good enough.
MID_KAGEROU_LEVEL3: Less than I'd like...
MID_KAGEROU_SKILL: I'll make greater gains with this\npower. I thank you.
MID_KAGEROU_JOIN: I am Kagero, a ninja from Hoshido.\nYou have a mission for me? Then I\nwill serve you from the shadows.
MID_KAGEROU_STRONGEST: I've been doing flower arrangements\nfrom whatever I can find in this\nworld. Here's my latest creation.$k$pWhat do you think of it? Ah. It looks\nlike something from a hellscape?\nWell, I appreciate your honesty.$k$pCurious to think how I'd have never\nbeen able to work with these flowers\nhad I not come to this world.$k$pIn a way, you have played a large\npart in the creation of this\nflower arrangement.$k$pI can thank you for many things,\nand most of all, that every one\nof us remains safe.$k$pSo I vow to keep you safe, no matter\nwhat dread events come to pass,\n$Nu.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE01: せいっ
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE02: はあっ
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE03: くっ…！
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE04: It doesn't hurt...
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE05: You have breathed your last.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE06: You are already dead.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE07: I'll finish this.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE08: Absolute annihilation!
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE09: Defeated...
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE10: Hmm.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE11: Have you known many ninja? We are a...unique breed.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE12: I always carry out my mission. No matter how grave the stakes.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE13: I value activities that require quiet and focus. Flower arranging. Tea ceremonies.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE14: My paintings, my flower arrangements... I'm afraid they're not to everyone's taste.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE15: A ninja should remain in shadow. Until she is summoned.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE16: Where is Lord Ryoma? I have a duty to protect him!
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE17: I am often nowhere to be seen in times of war. That's when I'm doing my...best work.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE18: Hmm?
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE19: Say the word.
MID_KAGEROU_VOICE20: Let's go.
