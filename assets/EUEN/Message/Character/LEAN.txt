MID_LEAN_HOME1: When it's time to go shopping, I\ndance to earn money for ingredients...\nWhat do you want for dinner?
MID_LEAN_HOME2: Through dancing, I transmit energy to\nthe audience. Even though I'm in a\nnew world now, that hasn't changed.
MID_LEAN_HOME3: You're always up so early.\nImpressive! Hey, why don't I\naccompany you on your rounds?
MID_LEAN_HOME4: As a dancer, I spend a lot of time on\nmy appearance. Of course, it starts\nwith clothes, but it doesn't end there...$k$pSo... Wanna take me shopping?
MID_LEAN_HOME5: Hey, $Nu...\nSomething wrong? What is it?\nYou keep looking my way...$k$pHa! I was just teasing. You can take it\neasy.
MID_LEAN_FRIEND: Hi there. I'm Lene! I've come all the\nway here just to say hello.$k$pHi, from $Nf!
MID_LEAN_LEVEL1: Perfect! I'm moving wonderfully\ntoday!
MID_LEAN_LEVEL2: That was about usual. At least I'm\nnot getting worse...
MID_LEAN_LEVEL3: That's no good at all! I guess I\nwas out too late last night.
MID_LEAN_SKILL: My body feels so light... I have\nsome ideas for new footwork—\nI'll show you later!
MID_LEAN_JOIN: I'm Lene! You'll get to know me faster\nif I dance instead of talk, so... Here\ngoes!
MID_LEAN_STRONGEST: Hmm... What color should I wear\ntoday? Just a touch of makeup, and...\nOh, $Nu!$k$pWhat's that? When you look at me,\nyou forget about the war? That's the\nidea—I dance to raise people's spirits!$k$pAnd if I dance in rags, it will just\nremind them of the war, not make\nthem forget about it.$k$pI am not a warrior... I am a dancer. I\nwant to bring a touch of color to\npeople's lives.$k$pIf I can make the sadness and the\nterror of fighting disappear from their\nminds, even for a moment, then...$k$pI've done my job.$k$pIf the war is getting you down, and\nyou're feeling exhausted... Just come\nand see me. I'll dance just for you!
