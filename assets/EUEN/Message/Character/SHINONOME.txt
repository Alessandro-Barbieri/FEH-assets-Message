MID_SHINONOME_HOME1: Summoners sure are amazing. If I\nhad that kind of power, I'd call the\nstrongest Heroes and spar nonstop!
MID_SHINONOME_HOME2: I may not look it, but I'm a prince of\nHoshido. Not that I knew this growing\nup in the Deeprealms...$k$pI still have trouble wrapping my head\naround one day becoming a king.
MID_SHINONOME_HOME3: Don't get so caught up in other tasks\nthat you neglect your training. I can\ntake over fishing duties for you.$k$pBesides, there's nothing like a freshly\ngrilled fish to get you pumped up!
MID_SHINONOME_HOME4: I know you're not much of a fighter,\nbut how about we test your strength?\nYou can arm wrestle, can't you?
MID_SHINONOME_HOME5: Yo, $Nu! You\ncaught me training. I really know my\nway around a lance, don't ya think?
MID_SHINONOME_FRIEND: Phew! I ran all the way here to give\nyou this greeting from\n$Nf.
MID_SHINONOME_LEVEL1: This is what I've been training for!
MID_SHINONOME_LEVEL2: Oh yeah! Getting stronger by the\nday!
MID_SHINONOME_LEVEL3: Maybe I didn't train enough... I\nneed to step it up.
MID_SHINONOME_SKILL: Is this your way of telling me I\nneed to build inner strength, too?
MID_SHINONOME_JOIN: I'm Shiro. Nice to meet ya! Have you\nheard of my father Ryoma? I'm\ntraining to be stronger than him!
MID_SHINONOME_STRONGEST: Yo, you got some time today? Then\nlet's chat! I've had something on my\nmind for a while now...$k$pYou're the strongest member of the\nOrder of Heroes, right? I mean, your\nstrategies are pretty solid...$k$pNot to mention how you can summon\nall those awesome Heroes!$k$pSince coming here, you helped me\nrealize there's more to being strong\nthan swinging a weapon.$k$pI've really come to admire your type of\nstrength. So I'll make up for the fact\nyou can't fight like the rest of us.$k$pIf you ever need help, just give me a\nholler and I'll come running. I'll take\nout any enemy who gets in your way!$k$pYou've truly mastered the power of\nyour soul. So until I learn how to use\nthat sort of strength for myself...$k$pallow me to fight by your side.

MID_SHINONOME_VOICE09: Father... I'm sorry...
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE10: Haha
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE11: You're saying I can get stronger by helping the Order of Heroes?
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE12: If you're feeling a bit sluggish, let's head out for a run.
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE13: Lances beat katana, so that means I should be able to best my father.
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE14: If it's all right with you, let me help out with your work around here. I can turn anything into a training session!
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE15: I want to test my skills. Do you know any Heroes who would be up for sparring?
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE16: Someday I'll inherit Raijinto from my father...
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE17: I always try to fight the strongest foes I can find, but I don't try to take them on alone anymore. I want to keep fighting by your side.
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE18: Right!
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE19: I'm Shiro!
MID_SHINONOME_VOICE20: Let's battle!
