MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_HOME1: Being marquess has me cooped up\nin a castle all day. I don't have time to\nmove around like this anymore.$k$pThat's a pretty big plus for this place!
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_HOME2: I often wonder who would win in a\nspar... My kid, or Eliwood's. Those\ntwo don't spar like we used to!
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_HOME3: Hey, try not to look like you're just\nloitering. The big boss has gotta be\nlooking in control and composed!$k$pHuh? Same goes for me? Aw, you\nknow as well as I do, that just isn't my\nstyle.
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_HOME4: Armads has been my stalwart partner\nfor quite some time. He loves to fight,\nso I bet you he's happy here!
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_HOME5: This castle never fails to impress. But\nmy hope is that someday kingdoms\nwon't need sturdy walls for protection.$k$pThere will just be peace.
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_FRIEND: I'm Hector, Marquess of Ostia. I'm\nhere at the request of your friend\n$Nf.$k$pCan you make sure their message\ngets to the right person?
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_LEVEL1: Oho, now this is more like it! The\ngreat Lord Hector's true power!
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_LEVEL2: Not bad, not bad... But I know\nthere's more I can do!
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_LEVEL3: Uh... Is that it? Maybe I'm losing\nmy touch.
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_SKILL: It's like polishing a diamond. I just\nget brighter and brighter!
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_JOIN: I'm Hector, Marquess of Ostia.\nArmads and I both are in your\nservice.$k$pMan, fancy introductions like that just\naren't my style...
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_STRONGEST: Mind sitting with me for a bit? There's\nsomething I want to ask you.$k$pDo you...believe in destiny?$k$pNot too long ago, I would've laughed\nat the idea. But now... Well, things\nsure have changed.$k$pWhether or not you believe in destiny\nisn't what matters. What matters is\nthat you don't regret your decisions.$k$pAs long as you're strong to the core,\nyou'll be ready no matter what the\nfuture throws at you.$k$pYou won't blink when faced with a life-\nor-death moment.$k$pThis goes for me... But it goes for you,\ntoo. I can just tell. The look on your\nface says it all.$k$pI know, I know, I'm not usually one for\ntalks such as these. Being marquess\nis one thing I'm not cut out for.$k$pBut I guess... It is what it is, right? And\nthat means I've gotta lecture from\ntime to time, so just work with me.

MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_VOICE13: My brother's burden and his feelings for his people... I will carry them myself.
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_VOICE14: Sitting on some throne isn't really my style... But...
MID_HECTOR_LEGEND01_VOICE15: Someday my kid and Eliwood's will spar. That'll settle who's stronger, once and for all.
