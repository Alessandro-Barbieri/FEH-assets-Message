MID_JHOSUA_HOME1: I've got a pretty heavy task ahead of\nme. You could say my gambling has\nbeen a way to test my luck.$k$pA way to make sure I'm ready for it.
MID_JHOSUA_HOME2: As a journeyman, I traveled far and\nwide. I worked as a mercenary back\nthen.$k$pMade a fair bit of money gambling at\npubs, too!
MID_JHOSUA_HOME3: This place is a lot different from my\ncountry, but it's pretty nice. Could use\na gambling hall, though...
MID_JHOSUA_HOME4: So... You want to make a bet? Ha,\ndon't worry. You're an amateur, so I'll\ngo easy on you!
MID_JHOSUA_HOME5: The way I see it, there are two ways\nto look at gambling. Sure, you could\nlose all your money...$k$pBut you could also consider that\npaying your tuition! After all, losing\nis a valuable life lesson, innit?
MID_JHOSUA_FRIEND: Your pal $Nf\nasked me to give you this and was\ninsistent I not gamble it away.
MID_JHOSUA_LEVEL1: Hm. Must be what they call\n"dumb luck."
MID_JHOSUA_LEVEL2: My luck hasn't run dry yet.
MID_JHOSUA_LEVEL3: Not my lucky day...
MID_JHOSUA_SKILL: I'll use this strength for Jehanna,\nfor my mother...and for everyone.
MID_JHOSUA_JOIN: I'm Joshua, a mercenary. Did a coin\nflip bring me here? Well, either way...\nI guess you're my new boss.
MID_JHOSUA_STRONGEST: I left my home at a young age to\ntravel the land. I spent a long time just\nwandering all over.$k$pLooking back, it may not have been\nthe smartest decision... But it did\nlead me to you.$k$pI'll return to my country eventually.\nThen I'll succeed to the throne and\ndevote myself fully to ruling.$k$pOh, did I mention? I'm the crown\nprince of Jehanna. And when I go\nback, I want you to come with me.$k$pI don't need your answer now, but\ngive it some thought. Maybe we can\nflip a coin to decide?
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE02: 悪いな
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE04: ついてねえ…
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE05: Don't hold this against me.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE06: Sorry, friend.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE07: Care for a wager?
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE08: I'll test your worth!
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE09: All outta luck...
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE10: Heh.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE11: Care to test your luck? Heads, I win—tails, you lose.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE12: Hm? Guess you caught me cheating, huh?
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE13: How about a small wager on the toss of a coin? I choose tails.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE14: Hm, it's heads. Today must be your lucky day.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE15: Oops, that's tails. Looks like I win this one.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE16: Mother, forgive me. One day, I will return to our country, just as I promised. I swear it...
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE17: I could use your help. If I win our next bet, lend me your aid.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE18: Lucky me.
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE19: Heads or tails?
MID_JHOSUA_VOICE20: Decided?
