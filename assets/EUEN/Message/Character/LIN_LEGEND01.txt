MID_LIN_LEGEND01_HOME1: The Kingdom of Askr is such a\nstrange place. Nothing like the plains\nof my homeland, or even like Caelin.$k$pYet, for some reason... It feels so\nfamiliar.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_HOME2: The people of the plains don't need to\nloose countless arrows to hunt. We\nneed but a single, well-aimed shot.$k$pThis helps ensure our prey does not\nsuffer needlessly.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_HOME3: Hmm... What can I do to take some of\nthe burden off you? I know. Maybe a\ngood sparring session will help.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_HOME4: A spirit of protection resides within\nthis bow. Reach out your hand... Do\nyou feel the winds of the plains?
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_HOME5: Hii-yaah! O-oh, it's you! I'm so sorry!\nHere, let me help you up...$k$pAlthough, you really shouldn't just tap\nme on the shoulder like that while I'm\nmeditating.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_FRIEND: I'd be delighted if you could remain\ngood friends with\n$Nf.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_LEVEL1: Amazing... The spirits must be to\nthank for this.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_LEVEL2: There's a strong tailwind. My\narrows will fly true.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_LEVEL3: The wind blows against us. But\nwatch me next time...
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_SKILL: I can fight because I have you at\nmy side.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_JOIN: My name is Lyndis, and I'm here to\nhelp. All threats to this world will be\nscattered to the winds.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_STRONGEST: Eliwood, Hector, and I once fought a\nfierce battle—together wiping away a\ncalamity that threatened the world.$k$pThe Archsage Athos said an evil star\nwould rise and see the land once\nagain awash in blood.$k$pI used to await that day in fear,\nconstantly wondering when it would\nfinally arrive.$k$pHowever, I'm no longer afraid. If we\nsaved the world once, we can save it\nagain.$k$pIt's thanks to the time I've spent with\nyou that I feel this way.$k$pThe next time I'm all alone on the\nplains, or whenever my chest tightens\nwith worry... Thanks to you, I...$k$pIt's these precious moments with you\nthat will allow me to carry on. Thank\nyou, $Nu.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE01: はぁっ！
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE02: Wind...
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE04: I won't lose!
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE05: It's time to end this.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE06: I'll hit my mark.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE07: One arrow, one kill.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE08: Aim well and victory is assured.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE09: I let you down...
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE10: ふふふ
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE11: You're calling me a Legendary Hero? I'm just Lyn. I'm nowhere near that grand.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE12: Look, I'm pretty sure I told you this before—cut it out already.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE13: *deep breathes in and out*
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE14: Can you feel it? The same breeze that caresses our skin carries my arrows to their targets.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE15: Once loosed, an arrow will go where I aim it. I've trained long enough—I know.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE16: If I was able to save one world, then surely I can save this one too.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE17: Stick by me. I don't want to lose anyone I care about.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE18: Onward.
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE19: What's the plan?
MID_LIN_LEGEND01_VOICE20: Taking aim!
