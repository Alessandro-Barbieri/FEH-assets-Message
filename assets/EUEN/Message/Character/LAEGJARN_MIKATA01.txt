MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_HOME1: This place is nothing like Múspell or\nNifl. I hope to come to understand it\nbetter. One day, I may need to.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_HOME2: Strength rules all. The weak are prey.\nThat is the way of Múspell... It is very\ncruel.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_HOME3: My sister Laevatein is everything to\nme. I would gladly give all I have to\nkeep her safe.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_HOME4: I had no talent for war, so I had to\nthink very hard about what someone\nlike me could contribute.$k$pWeak as I was, I found a way to\nsurvive in Múspell.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_HOME5: If you are tired, rest. I will stand guard\nwhile you sleep.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_FRIEND: My name is Laegjarn. I am a general\nof $Nf's army.$k$pI have undertaken the task of\ndelivering a greeting to you.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_LEVEL1: I will contain the blood of Múspell,\nthe flame dragon, that runs in me.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_LEVEL2: I am Laegjarn, general of\n$Nu's army!
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_LEVEL3: I need to get stronger, or I won't\nbe able to protect her...
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_SKILL: I swear on my name, I will repay\nthis debt someday.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_JOIN: I am Laegjarn, a general of Múspell. I\nwill serve you, but I have one request:\nallow me to see Laevatein, my sister.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_STRONGEST: My father would use his flames to kill\nthe weak—even his own children. He\nnever showed the slightest hesitation.$k$pEver since I was a child...I've seen\nhim do it. Many, many times.$k$pEvery day of my life, I lived in fear,\nbut...I had a little sister.$k$pShe looked up to me, and I was\ndetermined to protect her.$k$pThat feeling got so intense that it\neclipsed everything else; it's bigger\nthan I am. She made me strong.$k$pNow, I can be a commander, a\nsheath... Whatever is needed, I can\nbe, for your sake.$k$pYou give me strength. Lead, and I will\nfollow. From now on, and until the\nvery end, if you allow it.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE01: はぁっ！
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE02: この…！
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE04: That's dirty...
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE05: No pity.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE06: Resist and perish.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE07: Better me than her.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE08: This is how it's got to be.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE09: It's up to you now, Laevatein...
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE10: ふっ…
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE11: I am Laegjarn. Laevatein is my younger sister.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE12: Huh? What did you do that for?
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE13: Don't worry about me. Just do whatever you can to help my sister. Please.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE14: As an enemy general, I've prepared for the disgrace of being your captive.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE15: My father is flame. Everything he touches will be burned, until there is nothing left.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE16: Laevatein, my sister. If you could only...
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE17: I've never met anyone like you.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE18: If I must.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE19: Hmm.
MID_LAEGJARN_MIKATA01_VOICE20: As you say.
