You and I, now.$k$pI sense that you find me strange.\nPerhaps even stranger than\nmost people here find me.$k$pI am from the deep desert, and those\nfrom outside it see me as\noutside themselves.$k$pDo you feel the same? About me?\nOr more importantly, about\nyourself?$k$pYou and I are the same in one\nregard. We both want to ensure\nthat peace persists.$k$pLike the sands of time, which flow\nbut never change, you and I will\nalways be there for the world.
