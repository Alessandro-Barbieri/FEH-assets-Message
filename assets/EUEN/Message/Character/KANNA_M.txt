MID_KANNA_M_HOME1: You are the best, Summoner!\nHey, you can call up all sorts of\ndifferent Heroes, right?$k$pSo can you summon a friend to\nplay with me? Someone who can\nturn into a dragon, like I can!
MID_KANNA_M_HOME2: I used to live in a place that was\nsomewhere in the Deeprealms.$k$pAlmost all that time, I couldn't fight\nat all, but now I can use a sword.\nAnd a dragonstone too!
MID_KANNA_M_HOME3: Thanks for saying hi. Let's play a\ngame when you're done with work.\nI'll get lots of other people too!
MID_KANNA_M_HOME4: Next time we battle, you should hop\non my back when I'm a dragon!$k$pI know you don't usually go onto the\nbattlefield with us, but then you\ncould. We'd never lose!
MID_KANNA_M_HOME5: Don't tell Mama that I play catch with\nmy dragonstone. See? Sparkles really\nneat when I toss it in the air!
