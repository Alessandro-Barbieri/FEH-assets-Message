MID_KATUA_SPRING02_HOME1: It has gotten a little warmer, hasn't\nit? We are at war, I know...but you\nmust take a break sometime.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_HOME2: I have never really had the chance to\npause and enjoy the changing of the\nseasons before...$k$pSpring really is lovely, isn't it?
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_HOME3: How about some training? I know the\nspring festival is exciting, but we can't\nget carried away.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_HOME4: You'll see a lot of rabbits at the spring\nfestival. They represent prosperity\nand fertility.$k$pI hear that some visitors even wish\non them, hoping to be blessed with a\nchild that's healthy and happy.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_HOME5: Now that it's getting warmer, it might\nbe a good time to scrub down the\npegasi. I'm sure they'd enjoy it.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_FRIEND: I bring $Nf's\ngreetings. That's not why I'm\ndressed like this, though.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_LEVEL1: Spring brings growth. Something\ngood is on its way...
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_LEVEL2: The breeze is gentle and warm...
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_LEVEL3: Spring may be on its way, but it\nisn't here quite yet.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_SKILL: This is a fresh start, like the first\nday of spring. I will do my best.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_JOIN: I'm Catria of the Whitewings. These\nclothes... They're part of my mission.\nJust...try to forget about them.
MID_KATUA_SPRING02_STRONGEST: Stopping to enjoy a spring festival...\nIt's a little bit hard for me to wrap my\nhead around, frankly.$k$pThe thought would never have\ncrossed my mind before. I was too\nbusy fighting for my life...$k$pThen again, perhaps the struggles we\nwent through give meaning to our\ncelebrations today.$k$pOh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take the\nconversation down such a serious\npath. I can't help but speak my mind...$k$pReally, I should just drop everything\nand enjoy myself for now. But that's\nnot a thing I really know how to do.$k$pMaybe you can help me figure it out—\nhelp me figure out how to change.$k$pWhen I'm with you, I feel like I can get\na glimpse into what it might be like...to\nlive a different life.$k$pThank you,\n$Nu.
