MID_ZEFHYR_HOME1: All civilization was sadness from the\nstart. One man's climb based on\nanother man's fall. It must end.
MID_ZEFHYR_HOME2: Equality and quietude! They're my two\ngreat wishes for my world. We need\nonly surrender it to dragons.
MID_ZEFHYR_HOME3: Talk is pointless. But deeds make a\ndifference. Difficult deeds most of all.\nNow, what have you and I in common?
MID_ZEFHYR_HOME4: Does your world still teem with\nhumans? Then, no doubt, it knows\nnothing but the horror of war.
MID_ZEFHYR_HOME5: You may wonder what I am doing,\nstanding here, right now. I am waiting\nfor time to pass—peacefully.
MID_ZEFHYR_FRIEND: You may bow. I have come to\ndeliver greetings from\n$Nf.
MID_ZEFHYR_LEVEL1: My dream further unfurls its\ngreat wings!
MID_ZEFHYR_LEVEL2: More power, yes. But that is\nmy least concern.
MID_ZEFHYR_LEVEL3: I suppose I am...only human.
MID_ZEFHYR_SKILL: My Eckesachs yearns for greater\nbattles!
MID_ZEFHYR_JOIN: I am Zephiel, King of Bern. I hope you\naren't one of those types who spouts\nnonsense about hope for humanity.
MID_ZEFHYR_STRONGEST: I've long had the conviction that\nhumanity had no more worth\nthan the least of all fleas.$k$pAnd then...you.$k$pYour deeds here, and those of\nthe others... Every good act has\nwhittled at my certainty.$k$pWhat I am saying is that you\nhave earned my attention.\nStill, be careful.$k$pThe last person to toy with my\nrespect was my father. Ultimately,\nI had to put an end to him.$k$pNow, you have a throat. And I,\na hand. Let us hope the two\nnever have need to meet.

MID_ZEFHYR_VOICE11: What could you possibly want of me?
MID_ZEFHYR_VOICE12: I have absolutely no tolerance for impertinence.
MID_ZEFHYR_VOICE13: You...are like an infant. Take that any way that you will.
MID_ZEFHYR_VOICE14: Humanity...is grotesque.
MID_ZEFHYR_VOICE15: Pointless. All of it. Utterly pointless.
MID_ZEFHYR_VOICE16: My world must be freed. Humanity, expunged.
