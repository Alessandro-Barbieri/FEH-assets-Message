MID_LEVN_HOME1: I once thought that those who crave\nauthority should simply take it.$k$pAs it turns out, that was my way of\njustifying my own weakness. I had\nwalked away from my responsibilities.
MID_LEVN_HOME2: Silesse is a quiet country of snow-\ncovered trees...$k$pConcealing the avarice of the nobility\nand burying the blood spilled by its\ncitizens.
MID_LEVN_HOME3: You're steadfast in your duty, aren't\nyou? Unlike me.$k$pOne thing, though. Learn to be\nflexible, or you may miss what's right\nin front of your nose.
MID_LEVN_HOME4: There's a song I'd like to play if\nyou'd be so kind as to listen. It\nreminds me of the past.
MID_LEVN_HOME5: What did you think of my\nperformance? I certainly look the\npart, don't I?$k$pDon't forget that I can fight as well.\nI'm not half bad at that, either.
MID_LEVN_FRIEND: I'm here for $Nf.\nLet me play you a tune.
MID_LEVN_LEVEL1: As gentle as a breeze...
MID_LEVN_LEVEL2: Not so bad. I'll get there in the end.
MID_LEVN_LEVEL3: Is that all?
MID_LEVN_SKILL: So you'd like me to fight... Indeed, it\nis my duty. I will make use of this.
MID_LEVN_JOIN: Hello there! The name's Lewyn. I'm a\nsimple traveler, a wayward bard...\nThough there is more to my tale.
MID_LEVN_STRONGEST: Very good work preparing for the\nbattles ahead. You're very skilled.\nI respect that.$k$pDon't make that face. I'm serious!\nYou've impressed me. I've seen all\nyou do to help that trio from Askr.$k$pThe only thing I can't figure out is\nwhat matters to you.$k$pDo you have a goal? Something to\nprotect? Do you have the resolve\nneeded to see everything through?$k$pIf you lack these things, stop fighting\nnow. Moving forward blindly...could\ncost you your life.$k$pYou don't want that, do you? Take a\ngood look at yourself. Otherwise,\nat a critical moment...you'll fall.$k$pAs for me, I can't die yet because I\nhaven't done what needs to be done.\nOne fool like me is enough...$k$pTake care of yourself,\n$Nu.
MID_LEVN_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_LEVN_VOICE02: せいっ！
MID_LEVN_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_LEVN_VOICE04: ちっ…！
MID_LEVN_VOICE05: Forseti's rage!
MID_LEVN_VOICE06: Think you can handle it?
MID_LEVN_VOICE07: Just give up.
MID_LEVN_VOICE08: Sorry, but this is the end.
MID_LEVN_VOICE09: There's still much to do...
MID_LEVN_VOICE10: (maybe a sigh?)
MID_LEVN_VOICE11: I'm nothing more than a wayward bard.
MID_LEVN_VOICE12: You're persistent! Interested in me, are you?
MID_LEVN_VOICE13: This tome, Forseti, has been passed down by the royal family for years. But, for me, it's so much more than just some heirloom.
MID_LEVN_VOICE14: I used to think it better that the king be a man who brims with the ambition to rule.
MID_LEVN_VOICE15: Lead the world warmly, gentle as a breeze... That's a noble way to live.
MID_LEVN_VOICE16: Past or present, it doesn't matter... I am nothing but a feckless minstrel.
MID_LEVN_VOICE17: I can see the light in you. That light brings hope to everyone it shines on.
MID_LEVN_VOICE18: Ah.
MID_LEVN_VOICE19: Only if you're good...
MID_LEVN_VOICE20: All right.
