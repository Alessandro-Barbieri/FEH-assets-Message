MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_HOME1: Oh, Brother, where have you gone?\nTell me, is my brother here in this\nworld?
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_HOME2: My brother gave me this book. I've\nread it so many times I know it by\nheart. But I read it again and again...
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_HOME3: If somebody gets in your way, well...\nI'll pop their head right off... Just like\nI used to do with my dolls.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_HOME4: From the back of a horse, you can\nsee far into the distance... Do you\nwant to ride with me?
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_HOME5: Is the Veronica of this world anything\nlike me? I must meet her.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_FRIEND: Nobody is as loyal to me as\n$Nf is.\nYou should serve Embla, too.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_LEVEL1: Seeing me get stronger... Does it\nmake you happy?
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_LEVEL2: I'm doing things the way that my\nbrother taught me.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_LEVEL3: Don't look at me like that. It's...\nunsettling.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_SKILL: Wise. Granting power to me means\ngranting power to yourself.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_JOIN: I am Veronica. I take it that it was\nyour voice I heard calling me here...\nThat is fine. I will help you.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_STRONGEST: Who are you,\n$Nu?$k$pYou are the legendary summoner. But\nyou're not who I thought you would\nbe...at all.$k$pYou're kind... I expected someone\nmuch more imposing.$k$pBack in my world, I spent so much\ntime thinking about how I'd kill you...\nBut now...$k$pI have an idea. After we find my\nbrother, I want you to show me\nwhere you come from.$k$pI want to understand who you really\nare.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE01: それ
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE02: どいて…
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE04: ひどい…

MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE07: Just like my brother...
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE08: On your way.

MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE10: ふぅん…
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE11: I'm with you.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE12: There, there...
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE13: I am Veronica. However, I am different than the Veronica you know.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE14: Don't treat me like a child. What do you want?
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE15: My brother and Xander taught me how to ride a horse.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE16: I wonder... Has my brother come to hate the very sight of me?
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE17: When I'm with you... I don't get so lonely.
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE18: Hmmm...
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE19: Did you call for me?
MID_VERONICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE20: I will fight.
