MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_HOME1: I am told that this attire is fitting. How\nlittle protection it affords in battle!\nI am confident in my skill, but still...
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_HOME2: Picture him, on a visit to the sea...\nTrying to wrest a shark from the\nwater using only his bare hands...$k$pKnowing Ephraim, he could actually\nmanage the feat.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_HOME3: Does your country border the ocean,\n$Nu?\nFrelia's seas are a sight to behold.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_HOME4: You'd don a swimsuit? To what end?\nDo you mean to challenge me in the\nwater? I'd think again, were I you...$k$pI am as talented a swimmer as I am\nan archer.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_HOME5: It's important to stretch before\nswimming. Preparation is essential\nfor any situation. Heed my words!$k$pNow, let's see how flexible you are.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_FRIEND: I bear greetings and an array of\ntropical fruit as a symbol of friendship,\nall from $Nf.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_LEVEL1: No matter how I am attired, I\nam without flaw.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_LEVEL2: I'm getting used to all of this, it\nseems.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_LEVEL3: Absurd. This does not happen to\nme.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_SKILL: Very well. I will strive to flourish\nunder your leadership.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_JOIN: Please excuse my casual dress... I\nam Innes, prince of Frelia.$k$pYou'll have to allow me to make an\nofficial introduction at another time...\nWhen I am attired appropriately.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_STRONGEST: Approaching from this angle won't\nlead to a clean split. But if I were to\nchange my tactics, what then?$k$pDon't just stand there gawping. Did\nyou have need of my counsel,\n$Nu?$k$pNo? Well, then. I imagine this mound\nof melons has already led you to\ndeduce my intentions...but I'll explain.$k$pI'm practicing splitting watermelons.\nThis is a folk custom from some realm\nor other... A summertime contest.$k$pWhoever can split a watermelon most\npowerfully and cleanly while\nblindfolded is judged victorious.$k$pEven if it's a silly custom, my pride\nwon't allow for any less than top\nperformance.$k$pThere is always a chance that, some\nday, I may face Ephraim in this trial!\nI must be prepared!$k$pJoin me! Grip the stick, and strike at\nthe melon as at the heart of your rival!

MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_VOICE10: Hmph.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_VOICE11: I will be king of Frelia one day. Don't even think of underestimating me simply because I'm dressed for leisure.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_VOICE12: Well done! You snuck right up on me.
MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_VOICE13: I certainly don't have time to waste splashing around in the water like... Like some do.

MID_HEANIUS_SUMMER03_VOICE20: Get ready to swim.
