MID_CAMILLA_DREAM01_STRONGEST: Smothering someone with affection\nis one way to express your love for\nthem, I know...$k$pBut is it the right way? No, I do not\nbelieve it is.

And to\ndo that...you must be harsh at times.$k$pThat is why I am strict with you as\noften as I am kind.$k$pI believe that this is the way I can\nhelp you achieve your aims in the\nlong run, $Nu.
