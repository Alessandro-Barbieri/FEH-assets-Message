MID_CYAS_HOME1: To think that the wind can carry the\nstink of war to a country as peaceful\nas this one... It is a sin.
MID_CYAS_HOME2: People love to flatter me, so they call\nme a tactician.$k$pI'm hardly an ambitious man, but I\ndo hate to see movement wasted.
MID_CYAS_HOME3: On patrol? Excellent. Understanding\nthe situation on the ground is the first\nstep to formulating a strategy.$k$pYou ought never forget that\nthoroughness is a virtue.
MID_CYAS_HOME4: What a solemn expression! Though a\nhumble clergyman I may be, you must\nfeel free to consult with me anytime.
MID_CYAS_HOME5: Have you seen the castle's library?\nWhat a collection! Such history! I\ncan't wait to spend time perusing it.

MID_CYAS_JOIN: I am Saias of Velthomer. With my lord\nBragi as my guide, I hope my poor\nabilities will be of some service.
MID_CYAS_STRONGEST: How are you faring? Your face is\ntwisted into a most curious\nexpression...$k$pIt's almost as if you can see the future\nitself laid out in front of you.$k$pI overestimate you? But only one who\nis extraordinary need protest that they\nare ordinary...$k$pMy blood has granted me gifts, it's\ntrue. I have expended every effort to\nbe worthy of those gifts.$k$pThat same blood makes it impossible\nfor me to live a peaceful life. That's\na lesson I learned from my mother...$k$pAs long as you do not stray from your\npath, my knowledge and abilities will\nremain at your disposal.$k$pI swear it on the flame that marks my\nskin.

MID_CYAS_VOICE11: I can't discuss the topic of my lineage, I'm afraid.
MID_CYAS_VOICE12: Eh? My, you aren't shy, are you?
MID_CYAS_VOICE13: A thousand pegasi led by one dragon can defeat a thousand dragons led by one pegasus.
MID_CYAS_VOICE14: The Heroes gathered here are as dragons. I suppose that you, too, could be called a dragon.
MID_CYAS_VOICE15: Lord Julius was once kindhearted. Since that fateful day, however...
MID_CYAS_VOICE16: As the descendant of Fjalar, I must live on.

MID_CYAS_VOICE18: Yes.

MID_CYAS_VOICE20: I'll hear your plan.
