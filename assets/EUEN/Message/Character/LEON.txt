MID_LEON_HOME1: So, I came out of that divine weapon\nof yours, right? Ugh. A disgraceful\nway to summon royals!
MID_LEON_HOME2: My retainers are Niles and Odin.\nYou might find them...odd. But\nthey're really not bad fellows.
MID_LEON_HOME3: Good work with the patrols. It seems\nthat the Order of Heroes keeps you on\nyour toes. Let me know if I can help.
MID_LEON_HOME4: I'm hoping this place maintains a\nlibrary. I'd love to pore over books\nof this realm—especially its history.
MID_LEON_HOME5: I have mastery over gravity, but I'll tell\nyou, it's not the best idea to shake a\ntree for fruit. What a...mess.
MID_LEON_FRIEND: Hello there. I've come to convey\ngreetings from someone you know\nnamed $Nf.$k$pSo, there you go.
MID_LEON_LEVEL1: Amazing! Then again, I did work\nhard for it.
MID_LEON_LEVEL2: Any growth is good growth.
MID_LEON_LEVEL3: Given that, I can hardly call\nanyone else a disgrace.
MID_LEON_SKILL: You have my gratitude for giving\nme more power.
MID_LEON_JOIN: I am Leo, a prince of Nohr. I hold the\ndivine tome Brynhildr, which grants\nme mastery over gravity.$k$pWith less than a gesture, I have\nblasted many a fool to ashes.
MID_LEON_STRONGEST: I'm not surprised to see you here,\n$Nu.\nYou always seem eager to chat.$k$pEven when I am cold and distant\nwith you, you check up on me\nafter battle with a kind word.$k$pAnd that concern and connection\nhave made me stronger than I've\never been.$k$pThis isn't something I would\nnormally say aloud, but you make\nme feel valuable—even needed.$k$pThat's why...I want you always to\nstay by my side.$k$pI never would have imagined this\nwhen I first got here, but...I feel\nas if I could trust my life to you.$k$pArgh, I sound pathetic. I don't\nimagine you'll ever let me hear\nthe end of this, will you?
MID_LEON_VOICE01: せやっ！
MID_LEON_VOICE02: ほら…
MID_LEON_VOICE03: うわっ！
MID_LEON_VOICE04: I can take it...
MID_LEON_VOICE05: You can't hide from me.
MID_LEON_VOICE06: To ashes with you!
MID_LEON_VOICE07: Contemptible fool.
MID_LEON_VOICE08: May darkness claim you!
MID_LEON_VOICE09: What disgrace...
MID_LEON_VOICE10: Heh...
MID_LEON_VOICE11: Care to chat? I'm always up for stimulating discussion.
MID_LEON_VOICE12: I rarely while away the time. But glad to do so with you.
MID_LEON_VOICE13: I have achieved mastery over gravity, thanks to my divine tome, Brynhildr.
MID_LEON_VOICE14: You'd never guess what vegetable really catches my fancy. Tomatoes.
MID_LEON_VOICE15: If you ever see my collar inside out, please tell me. Not that it ever happens.
MID_LEON_VOICE16: Where are Niles and Odin? Those two, always gallivanting off...
MID_LEON_VOICE17: I'll expect clear orders in battle. Ugh, I'm sorry. I know you're on top of things.
MID_LEON_VOICE18: Yes?
MID_LEON_VOICE19: Ready.
MID_LEON_VOICE20: All right.
