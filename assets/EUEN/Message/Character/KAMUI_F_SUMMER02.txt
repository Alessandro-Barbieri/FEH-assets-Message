MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_HOME1: Sharena and Anna complimented me\non my swimsuit, but I have yet to see\neither of them wearing one.
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_HOME2: I won a ticket to an island resort but I\nwanted one of my siblings to use it.\nThey all refused so I wound up going.
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_HOME3: Has my swimsuit caught your eye? If\nI could take you shopping, I'm sure\nwe'd find one that suits you perfectly.
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_HOME4: I've never seen tropical fish before so\nI got this book that's all about them.\nWould you like to read it with me?$k$pExperiencing something for the first\ntime is much better if I can share it\nwith someone else!
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_HOME5: Do you know of any nearby Dragon\nVeins? If I find one, I can change\nsome land into a beach for you.
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_FRIEND: Sorry to show up in a swimsuit, but\n$Nf gave me\na message for you so I rushed out.
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_LEVEL1: What a lovely summer memory.\nI'll never forget it!
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_LEVEL2: I'll do my best right up to the end\nof summer!
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_LEVEL3: Perhaps my thoughts of the\nocean distracted me...

MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_JOIN: Hello. I'm Corrin. I was resting on a\nbeach when I heard someone calling\nmy name. Was that you?
MID_KAMUI_F_SUMMER02_STRONGEST: The tropical island was amazing. I\ncan see the crystal-clear water and\nblue sky every time I close my eyes.$k$pI spent so many years cooped up\ninside a fortress, so seeing such vivid\ncolors was a whole new experience.$k$pI had always dreamed of such sights.\nI could have spent the rest of my life\njust staring out at the water...$k$pBut I'm glad I didn't. I'm glad you\ncalled out to me, and I'm glad I\nanswered. It allowed us to meet.$k$pSpending time here with you and\nmaking so many new friends are\nthe perfect summer memories.$k$pThis place is every bit as wonderful as\nthat island.$k$pOh, here I am just rambling on and\non... Anyone ever tell you you're a\npretty good listener?$k$pWell, I hope you'll tell me about\nyourself the next time we get a\nchance to talk.
