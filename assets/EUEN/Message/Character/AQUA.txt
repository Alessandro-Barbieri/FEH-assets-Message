MID_AQUA_HOME1: Your uniform for this order is so\nattractive. And it's a lovely match\nfor what I like to wear too!
MID_AQUA_HOME2: I'm sorry to say that I mustn't ever\ntell you of my homeland. Still, I will be\nabsolutely true to you in battle.
MID_AQUA_HOME3: There's no knowing for how long\nyou and I will be here. So, friend, let's\nbe sure to take care of each other.
MID_AQUA_HOME4: I'm fond of singing, especially while\nstanding in lakes. Believe me, it's far\ndifferent from singing on battlefields.
MID_AQUA_HOME5: You'll often find me singing. I hope\nyou like songs. They convey truth in\nways that the written word cannot.

MID_AQUA_JOIN: My name is Azura. I offer you my song.\nAs for where I'm from? Two kingdoms,\nin a way... Both Nohr and Hoshido.
MID_AQUA_STRONGEST: You are the ocean's gray waves—♪\nSo you've come to see me again,\n$Nu...$k$pYou visit so often, I find myself\nlooking for you whenever I am\nsinging. You are a lovely audience. $k$pMy song is powerful, but that power\nis both great and terrible.$k$pIt can be used to rally and refresh\nthe spirit...or enslave it.$k$pBut it seems the song's power is\nmuch less in this world, as is the\ndanger to the singer.$k$pSo I can stay by your side to the\nend. And one day I will tell you of\nthe kingdom of silence I was born in.
