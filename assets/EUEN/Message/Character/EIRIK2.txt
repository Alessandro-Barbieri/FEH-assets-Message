MID_EIRIK2_HOME1: My brother, Lyon, and I... We shared\nso much when we were young. Lyon\ntaught me the fundamentals of magic.
MID_EIRIK2_HOME2: My brother is a skilled fighter, and\nLyon is a magical adept. I learned so\nmuch from both of them.
MID_EIRIK2_HOME3: Dark magic is generally not well\nregarded...but at a basic level, it is\nnot innately evil.
MID_EIRIK2_HOME4: Ephraim... Lyon... Perhaps, in this\nplace, we would be able to laugh\ntogether...just like we used to.
MID_EIRIK2_HOME5: I was just studying a tome of magic...\nIt reminded me how much my brother\nEphraim hated reading.$k$pHe called books "boring!" Hee-hee.
MID_EIRIK2_FRIEND: I've arrived bearing greetings from\n$Nf... Aah!$k$pMy apologies! You aren't hurt, are\nyou?
MID_EIRIK2_LEVEL1: This shall help me help Ephraim...\nAt least a little.
MID_EIRIK2_LEVEL2: Regular training is essential to\nmastering magic...and horses!
MID_EIRIK2_LEVEL3: Aah! Oh, I'm sorry! I nearly fell\nfrom my saddle!
MID_EIRIK2_SKILL: I thank you. I will do what I can\nto return your favor.
MID_EIRIK2_JOIN: My name is Eirika. My hope is to aid\nyou as best I can with the magic I\nhave learned.
MID_EIRIK2_STRONGEST: In the world I come from...I had a\nfriend who was very dear to me.$k$pLyon... I wish those days we spent\nlaughing with my brother could have\nlasted forever.$k$pThat feeling stays with me, even\nnow... A picturesque happiness,\nalmost like in a book...$k$pThe memories... My regrets... They\ncatch at my heart.$k$pSpending time with you, like this... I\nwish that this new happiness could\nlast forever, too.$k$pWe can never really know, can we?\nAll the same, I'd quite like to spend a\nlittle bit more time with you.
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE01: それっ！
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE02: 行きます！
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE04: このままでは…
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE05: Witness my magic!
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE06: What range!
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE07: Just like Lyon!
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE08: I'll apply what I've learned!
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE09: I'm sorry...Ephraim...
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE10: Um...
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE11: Now that I'm carrying a tome instead of a sword, I need to be careful. If the enemy gets too close, I can't fight back.
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE12: Gah! Wh-what?! Trying to keep me on guard, are you?
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE13: This is a whole new fighting style for me... It's so different from using a sword.
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE14: My friend Lyon had an aptitude for magic…
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE15: My brother has no aptitude for magic.
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE16: Ephraim... Lyon... If only things could go back to how they were...
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE17: If my study of magic will help you, then I'm glad to do it.
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE18: Orders, please.
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE19: What should I do?
MID_EIRIK2_VOICE20: Am I ready?
