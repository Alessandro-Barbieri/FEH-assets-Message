MID_LEAF_HOME1: This realm may be tranquil, but war\nfinds its way here all the same.$k$pWe must not give in. We will prevail!\nI just know we can do it!
MID_LEAF_HOME2: My home has fallen into the clutches\nof occupiers... But I will take it back\nfrom them.$k$pI have sworn this to my father, who\nthey killed.
MID_LEAF_HOME3: On patrol, are you? I'm keeping an\neye on you. I want to learn from your\nleadership.
MID_LEAF_HOME4: Do you have time to talk? I was\nhoping you'd give me some advice.\nI'd love to learn from you.
MID_LEAF_HOME5: I need to get stronger, so I was drilling\nwith my sword. I'm the descendant of\none of the 12 crusaders, after all.
MID_LEAF_FRIEND: This is the castle of\n$Nu, isn't it?$k$pI have a greeting here from\n$Nf.
MID_LEAF_LEVEL1: With strength like this, I'll be able\nto protect everyone!
MID_LEAF_LEVEL2: Good! I'm getting stronger.
MID_LEAF_LEVEL3: This can't be it. It can't!
MID_LEAF_SKILL: Thanks! I'll do everything I can to\nlive up to your expectations.
MID_LEAF_JOIN: I'm Leif, prince of Leonster. I've got a\nlot to learn about the world, but I'll\nlend you my strength all the same.
MID_LEAF_STRONGEST: I just wanted to tell you that I really\nappreciate everything you've done\nfor me.$k$pThanks to you, I've gotten much\nstronger. I may be a descendant of\none of the crusaders, but...$k$pI can't wield our family's divine\nweapon, and I'm not even close to\nmatching my father's strength.$k$pI've been frustrated by this for a long\ntime...so much so that I've made\nsome very stupid mistakes.$k$pI have learned one thing—you don't\nget strong overnight. I've got no\nchoice but to keep inching forward...$k$pAnd I want to continue to fight by your\nside. That's how I'll learn what true\nstrength is.$k$pWhat I want more than anything is the\nability to protect those who matter\nmost to me.
MID_LEAF_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_LEAF_VOICE02: ええいっ！
MID_LEAF_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_LEAF_VOICE04: It's nothing...
MID_LEAF_VOICE05: I won't run anymore.

MID_LEAF_VOICE07: I'll take it back...all of it!
MID_LEAF_VOICE08: This is my fight!
MID_LEAF_VOICE09: I failed you...
MID_LEAF_VOICE10: light laugh
MID_LEAF_VOICE11: I must become stronger. Much stronger.
MID_LEAF_VOICE12: Whuh... Is that some kind of greeting where you come from?
MID_LEAF_VOICE13: The night my country fell, the sky was red. I remember looking up at it from Finn's arms... I didn't understand what had happened.
MID_LEAF_VOICE14: I fled the castle. I abandoned them all — all the people it was my duty to protect.
MID_LEAF_VOICE15: I will never again let someone sacrifice their life in exchange for mine.
MID_LEAF_VOICE16: If I was stronger...just a little bit stronger...
MID_LEAF_VOICE17: You're a leader. There's a lot I can learn by watching you.
MID_LEAF_VOICE18: Yeah.
MID_LEAF_VOICE19: OK. Now what?
MID_LEAF_VOICE20: Come on!
