Heroes Message Name: Message


MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_HOME1: I worry my appearance is lacking the\ndecorum one requires to appear\nbefore Askran royalty, but...$k$pWell, the young prince and princess\ndon't seem to mind.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_HOME2: Before I came here, I was embroiled\nin a battle against my siblings and\nsome Hoshidan royals...$k$pIt was all over a ticket to a tropical\nisland. I won, of course. I have my\nretainers to thank for that.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_HOME3: Does the Order of Heroes allow for\nvacations? We'll take care of the\nenemy. You go relax on the beach.$k$pIt...can be fun.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_HOME4: Tell me, $Nu...\nCan you swim? If so, I would ask that\nyou teach me. Or, at the very least...$k$pTeach me how to float.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_HOME5: This water toy resembles an astral\ndragon Corrin cared for. I call the toy\nLilith. You may do so as well.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_FRIEND: Greetings from\n$Nf. You want\nto know if I'm going swimming?$k$pDon't be absurd. Everyone knows I\ncannot swim.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_LEVEL1: Could it be I'm more suited to\nfighting in a swimsuit?
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_LEVEL2: Hm... Passable results for fighting\nin such an outfit.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_LEVEL3: Has the heat dulled my senses?\nI must redouble my efforts.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_SKILL: You have my gratitude. This will\nbe a fine summer thanks to you.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_JOIN: I am Xander, Crown Prince of Nohr.\nI was at a beach practicing my\nswimming technique, so...$k$pWell, I'm afraid your sudden\nsummoning caught me off guard.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_STRONGEST: Pardon my saying, but I've had this\non my mind for some time...$k$pIt's awfully bold of you to force a\ncrown prince such as myself to fight\nin little more than a swimsuit.$k$pNo, no, I don't mean to sound upset.\nOn the contrary, in fact. I seldom get\nthe chance to feel free of my armor.$k$pAnd even more seldom do I feel so\nfree from the burdens of the crown.$k$pMy title of Crown Prince of Nohr\ncarries no weight in this realm.$k$pI can walk along clutching my water\ntoy Lilith and none give me a second\nglance.$k$pI've experienced nothing like it before.\nSo, $Nu you\nhave my gratitude. $k$pThank you for an unforgettable\nsummer. I shall remain by your side\nuntil I must return home.

MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE04: Lilith...!
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE05: Right where I want you!

MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE09: Back again...
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE10: Whew...
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE11: This garment lacks protection. That...concerns me.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE12: This flotation device is my only defense against my greatest adversary. Sinking.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE13: Sorting seashells... This one from that one... Good fun.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE14: I was asked to compose a list categorizing every...beauty of the beach? Odd request.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE15: I don't mean to scowl on a beach. I'm just concerned about things, that is all.
MID_MARKS_SUMMER02_VOICE16: I left my retainers behind. Worrisome. Chaos is ever their companion.
