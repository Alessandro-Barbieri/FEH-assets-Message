MID_IRA_HOME1: I've been observing the people\nhere—they know what they're doing. I\nfind that reassuring.
MID_IRA_HOME2: My country faces destruction. Nothing\nis more important than protecting our\nprince.
MID_IRA_HOME3: I fought beside Lord Sigurd until the\nvery end. I don't regret it for a second.
MID_IRA_HOME4: If you wish to study the sword, I'll\nteach you. But if you accept my offer,\ndon't expect me to hold back.
MID_IRA_HOME5: Flowers? Dresses? No thank you. I\ndon't have time to waste. If I have\nsome time, I grab my sword and train.
MID_IRA_FRIEND: My name is Ayra. I bring greetings\nfrom $Nf.
MID_IRA_LEVEL1: I have Od's blood to thank for this!
MID_IRA_LEVEL2: To study the sword is to walk a\nlong road. I walk it every day.
MID_IRA_LEVEL3: I must steady myself.
MID_IRA_SKILL: In Isaach, we repay our debts. I\nwill repay mine on the battlefield.
MID_IRA_JOIN: I am Princess Ayra of Isaach—a\ndescendant of the crusader Od.
MID_IRA_STRONGEST: Before I came here, I fought\nalongside my comrades in a great\nbattle. We were defeated.$k$pThat's just how it is. And even if I\ncould go back in time... I'd still fight.$k$pYes, I'd fight to the bitter end. I have\nno doubt. What's really important is\nhow you live your life.$k$pBeing here, with you...I can't\ncomplain. I'm satisfied with things as\nthey are.$k$pBut we might part ways—one day.\nKeeping that in mind reminds me how\nprecious our time together really is.

MID_IRA_VOICE12: Huh? Do that again, and you'll pull back a stump.
MID_IRA_VOICE13: If you're trying to give me a gift, save it. You should find a girl who cares about such things.
MID_IRA_VOICE14: Thanks to your strategy, I'm still here. I just wanted to let you know that I'm grateful.
MID_IRA_VOICE15: Ladylike? Me? You've got to be joking.
