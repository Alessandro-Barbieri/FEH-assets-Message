MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_HOME1: Clear blue skies, clouds in shapes I\ncan't even name, and an ocean that\nstretches on forever...$k$pAhh... Tropical islands are simply\nwonderful places.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_HOME2: I once bested my own brother Ryoma\nin a battle for a ticket to a tropical\nisland.$k$pI never would have succeeded had it\nnot been for Oboro and Hinata. I\nhave nothing but praise for those two.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_HOME3: Here, I brought you some water. You\nneed to remember to stay hydrated\nwith the sun beating down on you.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_HOME4: Admiring my swimsuit, huh? Oboro\nmade it for me. You should ask her to\nmake one for you, too!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_HOME5: When I'm away from home, I can't\nhelp but miss all the foods I grew up\nwith.$k$pBut there is a lot to be said for the\nfoods of another nation that you'd\nnever have back home.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_FRIEND: Hi, I'm Takumi. And yes, I'm wearing a\nswimsuit. Just take this message from\n$Nf, OK?
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_LEVEL1: I feel amazing... Summer and the\nbeach go hand in hand!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_LEVEL2: Nothing beats the feeling of the\nsummer sun's rays.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_LEVEL3: I'm sure I'm just tired from all the\nswimming...
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_SKILL: And with this power, I can now\nfully enjoy the summer!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_JOIN: Cannonbaaaall— Waah! Wh-where'd\nthe water go?! And where did I go?!\nAnd who are you?!$k$pMe? I'm Takumi, of Hoshido! Are you\nthe one who interrupted my vacation?
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_STRONGEST: The tropical island was so much more\nthan I expected. Each day was as\nexciting as the last.$k$pI was in a literal paradise, so you can't\nblame me for being a little bitter when\nyou first summoned me here...$k$pThat said, being here is just as\nsatisfying. This smile is all natural, if\nyou couldn't tell.$k$pI'm not ungrateful for the chance to be\nhere, but I do still have unfinished\nbusiness back on the island.$k$pSo let's end this world's fighting\nquickly and go back to it together.$k$pI'll show you how to really have some\nsummer fun! That's a promise,\n$Nu.

MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE08: Welcome to paradise!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE09: Bury me in sand...
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE10: Oh, hey!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE11: Truth is, I always wanted to go on that tropical vacation. I just think I should be honest about that...
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE12: This swimsuit is custom-made. Nice, right?
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE13: What do you want? Look, if you're bored, why don't we go play tag on the beach?
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE14: Heh! You keep poking me, but it's not like I've got any kelp stuck on my skin.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE15: It's thanks to my retainers that I was able to go on that tropical island trip in the first place.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE16: If I close my eyes, I can just picture it... That blue, blue sea...those beautiful skies...
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE17: I was really surprised when you called me here. But this place is pretty nice! I almost don't want to leave.
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE18: Haha!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE19: Let's go swimming!
MID_TAKUMI_SUMMER04_VOICE20: Diving in!
