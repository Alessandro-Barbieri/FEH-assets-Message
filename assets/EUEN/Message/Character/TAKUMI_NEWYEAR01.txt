MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_HOME1: I must admit, I feel somewhat out of\nplace here. There aren't many other\nHeroes wearing a kimono...$k$pAnd I'm the only one carrying mochi\naround.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_HOME2: I was celebrating the new year at\nCastle Shirasagi, unprepared to be\nsummoned out of the blue.$k$pNormally I'd have my Fujin Yumi with\nme, but...
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_HOME3: It's always so cold at the turn of a new\nyear. Are you warm enough? I wish I\nhad some warm ozoni with me...
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_HOME4: Huh? You want to make up some\nNew Year's fortunes? Fine...$k$pYou'll have good luck if there are at\nleast three Hoshidan Heroes in the\nplaza.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_HOME5: It's a new year, so I'll try to be a little\nmore forthright. I wanted you to know\nthat I respect your tactical capabilities.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_FRIEND: Happy New Year. I was instructed by\n$Nf to deliver\nnew-year greetings.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL1: As amazing as the first sunrise\nof the new year.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL2: This year, I'll become even\nstronger.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL3: I hope the entire year doesn't go\nthis way...
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_SKILL: A new power for a new year,\nhuh? Thanks.
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_JOIN: Happy New Year. I'm Takumi, Prince\nof Hoshido. Are we...exchanging\nnew-year gifts?
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_STRONGEST: I've been here since the new year's\nstart. Do you celebrate New Year's\nwhere you're from?$k$pWe have all sorts of traditions in\nHoshido.$k$pFor instance, we'll hang decorations\nresembling the Dawn Dragon facing\nthe sunrise to ward off evil.$k$pWe also have many delicious soups\nwe'll prepare— Hm? Why are you\nlooking at me like that?$k$pOh, you'd like to learn more about\nHoshidan New Year's traditions?$k$pWell, they're pretty involved, and\nexplaining them thoroughly will likely\ntake some time...$k$pBut as long as you're OK with that, I'd\nbe glad to tell you whatever you want\nto know.$k$pI can't say whether it's good fortune or\nbad, but there's no way of knowing if\nI'll ever be able to return home...$k$pSo, for as long as I'm here, I'll\ncontinue to chat with you like this.\nAfter all, I don't...dislike you.$k$pSo let's keep working together.\nSound good?

MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_VOICE13: What? Men wear kimonos like this for the New Year in Hoshido!
MID_TAKUMI_NEWYEAR01_VOICE14: It's Hoshidan tradition to give money to children on New Year's Day. That's...nice, I guess.
