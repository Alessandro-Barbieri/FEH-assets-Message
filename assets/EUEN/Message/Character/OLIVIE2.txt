MID_OLIVIE2_HOME1: Dancing is embarrassing enough, but\ndancing up in the sky is just plain\ndangerous! One mistake and I'll fall!
MID_OLIVIE2_HOME2: I've ridden in a wagon, of course, and\non horseback. But never did I think\nI'd ride something that can fly!$k$pAnd I especially didn't imagine I'd be\ndancing all the way up there...
MID_OLIVIE2_HOME3: Let me know if you start to feel worn\nout, OK? I'd be so glad if I could raise\nyour spirits with a dance!
MID_OLIVIE2_HOME4: Oh, I was just giving my friend here a\nmuch-needed brushing. Judging by\nhis reaction, he really likes it!
MID_OLIVIE2_HOME5: I just got back from the market. I\nfound a ton of fruits and vegetables\nthat I know falicorns just love!
MID_OLIVIE2_FRIEND: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm\nOlivia, a dancer with Chrom's\nShepherds.$k$pI've been entrusted with a letter to\nyou from $Nf.
MID_OLIVIE2_LEVEL1: I feel like I'm flying all on my own!\nIs this what it means to be one\nwith your steed?
MID_OLIVIE2_LEVEL2: My partner and I became fast\nfriends. He's such a good boy!
MID_OLIVIE2_LEVEL3: Hey, whoa! Stop! Listen to me!\nNo, you're going the wrong way!
MID_OLIVIE2_SKILL: Thank you! I promise I'll use this\nto soar to even grander heights!
MID_OLIVIE2_JOIN: My name is Olivia, and from atop my\nfalicorn I'll— Eek! W-wait, don't take\noff so suddenly! Please land!
MID_OLIVIE2_STRONGEST: O-oh! Were you watching me dance?\nWell, yes, you have a good eye... It is\na brand-new dance I'm working on.$k$pBut please don't tell anyone about it!\nIt's not ready for an audience yet, so\npromise me. OK?$k$pI thought I could make my dances\nmuch more expressive by making\nbetter use of the sky and my falicorn.$k$pFlying through the sky on his back for\nthe first time was such a moving\nexperience for me.$k$pThe sound of cutting through the\nwind, the color of the sky, the brisk\nair all around me...$k$pI want to convey all of those things\nthrough my dancing!$k$pMy hope is to give people who have\nnever flown before a sense of how\namazing it is.$k$pI've been trying a lot of new moves,\nbut it isn't going as well as I had\nhoped.$k$pI've taken my fair share of tumbles\nlately...$k$pBut when this new dance is finally\nready, I want you to be the first\nperson who sees it!

MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE11: I never know what to do!
MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE12: A gift from above!
MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE13: This is all so new to me. I'm used to dancing on a stage...on the ground...
MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE14: Oh! It's you! You, um... Y-you haven't been watching me practice, have you?
MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE15: The sky makes for a much higher stage than I'm used to... It gets my heart pounding.
MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE16: I've been practicing a dance with my new partner.
MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE17: If you'd like, I can arrange for you to watch my dance from a special seat atop another—oh! Oh, never mind, it's too embarrassing!

MID_OLIVIE2_VOICE20: The sky is my stage!
