MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_HOME1: Wriggle like a worm trying to escape\nmy boot, or die squished like a\nworthless maggot.$k$pEither way, you are little more than an\ninsect.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_HOME2: Ugh... My splitting head... I remember\nnothing of my time in that other\nworld... Nothing at all.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_HOME3: How about you stop pretending to be\nso selfless and tell me what you really\nwish for? Maybe I can grant it...
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_HOME4: You show promise, despite being\nhuman. Of course, that's like being\nthe smartest worm in the dirt.$k$pBut still... I see enough in you\nthat I could entertain the idea\nof keeping you by my side.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_HOME5: Memories or no, I will lay waste to the\nworld all the same. You think me so\nfickle I'd change my mind?
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_FRIEND: Heh, don't look so frightened. Your\nfriend $Nf is\nperfectly safe... For now.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_LEVEL1: Insolent worms... I shall teach you\nwhat it means to feel true fear.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_LEVEL2: I suppose this will be enough for\nstomping lowly insects.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_LEVEL3: I already possess more than\nenough power to crush humans.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_SKILL: This power surpasses that of the\ngods. I will bring destruction...
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_JOIN: I am the wings of despair. I am the\nbreath of ruin. I am the fell dragon,\nGrima.$k$pPay me the respect I am due, and I\nwill consider granting you a quick\ndeath when the time comes.
MID_REFLET_F_LEGEND01_STRONGEST: Come to butter me up some more?\nHow very irksome. I've nothing to\nchat about with a human.$k$pHumans spout their ideals, but it's\nnothing but lip service. Let's all join\ntogether and hold hands, you'll say.$k$pWe can overcome our differences\ndespite being different species,\ndespite our differing core ideologies.$k$pThe truth is what you see daily in this\nplace. Day after day, night after night,\nall you have is never-ending war.$k$pOne person's satisfaction means\nanother must suffer. That is the truth\nof all worlds.$k$pBut my power of destruction is the\none true equalizer.$k$pIf you think there's someone out there\ncapable of leading the world with such\nhigh-minded ideas of love and bonds...$k$pI'd love to meet them.$k$pHmph. After all that, you still talk your\nbig talk? Very well. I'll watch over\nyou... Right until your bitter end.
