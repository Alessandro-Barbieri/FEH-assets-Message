MID_MACHILDA_HOME1: This is a wonderful place. Everywhere\nI look, I see order—from the people to\nthe castle itself.$k$pThat's the soul of this kingdom and its\npeople. I'm sure of it.
MID_MACHILDA_HOME2: I was captured by the enemy...and\ncaused everyone a lot of trouble. But\nI'm fighting for the Deliverance now.

What I really want to\nask is this: what can I do?$k$pYou say that if I care this much, she'll\ncome around eventually? I hope so.\nFor now, I'll take your word for it.$k$pIt's strange, isn't it?
