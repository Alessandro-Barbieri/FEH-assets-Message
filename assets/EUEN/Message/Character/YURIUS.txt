MID_YURIUS_HOME1: Damn that Julia...$k$pDon't look at me like that! It's\ninfuriating. Leave!
MID_YURIUS_HOME2: How dare I hunt children? You\nmisunderstand. I was simply\neducating my subjects...$k$pThe gifted ones, at any rate.
MID_YURIUS_HOME3: Snooping around again, are you?\nSearching for a traitor in our midst,\nperhaps?$k$pHeh heh. Merely a joke, I assure you.
MID_YURIUS_HOME4: Have some free time? Let's see...\nThat flower bed is just crawling with\nbugs. Let's crush them all.
MID_YURIUS_HOME5: You know, if I get bored...I could tear\nthis castle stone from stone. Let's\nhope you keep me entertained.
MID_YURIUS_FRIEND: My name is Julius. I was forced\nto visit this tedious hovel by\n$Nf.
MID_YURIUS_LEVEL1: Hahaha! Think of the merriment\nI'll make!
MID_YURIUS_LEVEL2: Good enough, I suppose.
MID_YURIUS_LEVEL3: Dull.
MID_YURIUS_SKILL: It seems you do understand how\nto use power. I will gladly make\nuse of this.
MID_YURIUS_JOIN: I am Julius, Prince of Grannvale.\nWhat a lively place you have here!\nGood. I do so hate to be bored.
MID_YURIUS_STRONGEST: Why, hello,\n$Nu!\nBack from the slaughter?$k$pLet's talk about who you plan to crush\nnext. Tell me, what will you destroy?$k$pYou don't enjoy fighting, you say?\nDon't play coy with me.$k$pYou must enjoy it. Down to the very,\nvery depths of your soul, I think...$k$pPeople live by taking from others—by\ndefeating them, do they not? Those\nwho don't fight aren't fit to live.$k$pHuman kindness? There you go\nagain, spouting nonsense. Surely you\ndon't really mean it!$k$pYou may say whatever you like now,\nbut you'll be forced to acknowledge\nthe truth sooner or later.$k$pAnd when you find out what lies\nbeyond all of the fighting... I'll be\nwaiting for you, a smile on my face.

MID_YURIUS_VOICE11: Seliph is the Scion of Light? Ha! I suppose that makes me the Scion of Darkness!
MID_YURIUS_VOICE12: You'd taunt me? Are you mad?
MID_YURIUS_VOICE13: Julia is my sister. But I will kill her, oh yes.
MID_YURIUS_VOICE14: I cannot stand the sight of Reinhardt. The next time he appears before me, he will die.
MID_YURIUS_VOICE15: Gah! My head hurts. No, stay back, you!
MID_YURIUS_VOICE16: She said that I was kind? Oh, Julia. You do spout nonsense.

MID_YURIUS_VOICE18: Excellent.
MID_YURIUS_VOICE19: What do you desire?
MID_YURIUS_VOICE20: The game is on.
