MID_CELICE_HOME1: My father once taught me two\nvaluable lessons. That a ruler should\nknow the sorrows of his people.$k$pAnd that there is more than one\ntruth, no matter what anyone says\nto the contrary.
MID_CELICE_HOME2: I know how valuable you must be to\nPrince Alfonse as his tactician.\nI once had one of my own.
MID_CELICE_HOME3: Anyone who's borne the heavy weight\nof saving the world knows how nice\nit is to have the support of others.$k$pSuch people also know how daunting\nit can be to...meet their expectations.
MID_CELICE_HOME4: Do you fear war? To be honest,\nI am often scared of it, to the extent\nthat it keeps me up at night.
MID_CELICE_HOME5: To save everyone that I can, I must\ntrain hard to become every bit as\nstrong as my father was.
MID_CELICE_FRIEND: My name is Seliph. I bring word\nthat you are very important to\n$Nf.

I have truly only\never wanted one thing—to run away.$k$pStill, I have always done the opposite,\nfighting whoever I must. And do\nyou know why?$k$pBecause I have friends who inspire me,\nand you more than most. I need you...\nin order to be me. You see?$k$pI pledge to help you any way I can,\never at your side—now and\nwell into our future.
