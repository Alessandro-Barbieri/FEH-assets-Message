I was attempting to\npaint a portrait of you just now.$k$pI don't do this all that often, but\nobserving you moved me...$k$pYou're a captivating person—how you\nmove, how you summon, and even\nyour demeanor when we talk.$k$pBefore I knew it, I had brush in hand.\nPerhaps the fact that you summoned\nme draws me to you...$k$pI'd like to believe that my affection\nfor you is my own, though.$k$pI am thankful that I had this chance to\nshare my feelings with you today.$k$pThat said, do you mind if I continue\nto paint? I'd love to have you all to\nmyself, even for only a short time.
