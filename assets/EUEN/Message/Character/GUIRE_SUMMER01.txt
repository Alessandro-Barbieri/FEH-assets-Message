MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_HOME1: I bet you know all the hiding spots.\nFor candy, I mean! Your outfit...looks\nuseful for that.$k$pDressed like this, I don't have\nanywhere I can stash my sweets.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_HOME2: We got the army together at an\nOutrealms resort for some fun...$k$pWe collected shells and got attacked\nby bugs, and somebody tried to feed\nme a very disturbing cake.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_HOME3: Those Order of Heroes uniforms look\nreally toasty. Take a page from my\nbook and shed a few layers!
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_HOME4: Can I ask you a favor? Would you go\nand get some honey for me?$k$pI'd do it myself, but...would you be\nbrave enough to fight off bees while\ndressed like this? Me neither.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_HOME5: I guess that's just about enough\ntraining for today! If I hear another\ncrack about baby fat...
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_FRIEND: What are you looking at me like that\nfor? I know I look a little shifty...but I'm\njust delivering greetings! Honest.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_LEVEL1: After working so hard in the\nsummer heat...I deserve this.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_LEVEL2: I get the job done...no matter how\nI'm dressed.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_LEVEL3: Well, what did you expect? I'm\nwearing a swimsuit, here.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_SKILL: Thanks... Now let's sneak off and\neat ice pops together.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_JOIN: I'm Gaius. I don't turn down jobs,\neven when I'm on vacation. You got\none for me?
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_STRONGEST: Man, is it hot... Wait. What do you\nwant? I don't have any sweets to\nshare...$k$pYou saw the tattoo on my arm when\nI was swimming?!$k$pKeep it down! I'm trying to keep a lid\non that...$k$pIt's a mark they put on convicts\nwhere I come from. I did a favor for a\nbuddy, and that's what it got me...$k$pTalk is cheap, and I don't need your\npity. But...it's nice to know you're not\njudging me for my past.$k$pAnd you know what? It's summer. I\nshould let loose and try to have fun.\nBe a good guy for once.$k$pAfter all, I've got you on my side, don't\nI? Things could be worse!
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE02: Take this!
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE03: Choco!
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE04: You've done it now!

MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE10: Heh
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE11: When it's hot like this, you gotta choose sweets that won't melt.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE12: Ugh—I hate that ocean air. Too salty.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE13: The bandana? It's...well...it just looks cool, all right?
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE14: I fight better when I'm not so exposed.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE15: Even I wouldn't try to hide sweets in a swimsuit.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE16: One good thing about the tropics: sweet, sweet fruit all over the place.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE17: When it's hot like this, you can pay me in frozen-juice bars.

MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE19: Ugh.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE20: Sweet.
MID_GUIRE_SUMMER01_VOICE21: You expect me to steal stuff dressed like this?
