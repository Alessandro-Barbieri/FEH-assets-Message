MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_HOME1: What surprises me is this: how little I\nam surprised by being in a world I\nknow nothing about.$k$pAll those voices, the ones that called\nout for me... Perhaps that's why.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_HOME2: My father was praised by many as a\npeerless Warrior King.$k$pAnd I...I once made a joke about how\nhe'd outlive us all.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_HOME3: Well now, $Nu...$k$pAre you sure you're ready? To lead\non the battlefield, you need both\nstrength and stamina.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_HOME4: I've been spending time gazing at the\nstars in the sky...$k$pI don't know any of the constellations\nof this world, but it doesn't make\ntheir light any less beautiful.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_HOME5: I hope Eirika is all right...$k$pShe has always been by my side.\nNow that we're apart, I find myself\nworrying about how she fares.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_FRIEND: I'm Ephraim. $Nf\ntold me you're good in a fight. Want\nto spar? We can go one-on-one.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_LEVEL1: Sword or lance, it doesn't matter.\nIn a fair fight, I'll beat anyone with\nthis axe.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_LEVEL2: You know, axes aren't half-bad, as\nweapons go. I feel like I have more\noptions now.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_LEVEL3: Facing adversity brings meaning to\nyour life.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_SKILL: I feel completely vitalized and ready\nto go. It must be thanks to this.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_JOIN: I am Prince Ephraim of Renais.$k$pMy father, Fado, met an untimely\ndeath... In his place, I vow to protect\nthe people. Every last one.
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_STRONGEST: After my father's life was stolen...\nAfter our homeland was stolen...\nAfter everything I knew fell away...$k$pThat's when I vowed that I would\nprotect my kingdom in my father's\nstead.$k$pWhen my father was alive...that\nthought would never have crossed\nmy mind.$k$pI know that something I once said\ndisappointed him greatly.$k$pYou see, I said that Eirika should\nsucceed the throne while I lived the\nlife of a mercenary, lance in hand.$k$pWhat would my father say if he could\nsee me now? Would he be satisfied\nwith the man I've become?$k$pI'm sure he'd upbraid me. "You have\na long way to go," he'd say. He would\nbe right.$k$pI want to do what I can to become a\ngood king—to get ever closer to the\nideals he upheld.$k$pFor no other reason than to not\ndisappoint him once more.

MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_VOICE11: My outfit? Why, it's a suit of armor from Renais. It's... Ugh... Really heavy...
MID_EPHRAM_POPULARITY03_VOICE12: My father was Fado, king of Renais. He was known as a peerless Warrior King.
