MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_HOME1: I asked Commander Anna what she'd\nlike for the winter festival, and she\nsaid "money."$k$pI think I'll stick to asking kids that\nquestion. I'm not sure my holiday\nspirit will survive otherwise.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_HOME2: Before you summoned me, I was at a\nwinter festival party at Ylisstol. The\nentire halidom is in fine spirits!
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_HOME3: I'm feeling chilly again today... I need\nto come up with a plan to stay warm.\nI hope no one catches a cold.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_HOME4: Which Heroes are naughty, and\nwhich are nice? Just whisper their\nnames into my ear.$k$pI'll keep that info tucked away until\nthe next winter festival.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_HOME5: I was just taking care of my tree. It's\na bit of a pain to keep all of the\ndecorations on it during battle.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_FRIEND: Happy winter festival! I come with\ngreetings, but no gifts, from your\nfriend $Nf.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_LEVEL1: I will use this power to make the\nwinter festival even more exciting!
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_LEVEL2: My stocking was filled with\npotential for battle, I suppose.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_LEVEL3: This is no good at all! I'm trying\nto enjoy the winter festival...
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_SKILL: Well, if you're going to give me a\ngift, I'll do the best I can with it!
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_JOIN: My name is Robin. If you want\nsomeone to plan winter festivities,\nyou're in luck. Leave it all to me.
MID_REFLET_M_WINTER01_STRONGEST: I was just mulling over a plan. What\nplan? How to help my dear friend—\nthat's you—enjoy the winter festival.$k$pWell, first, you're going to need a red\noutfit like mine.$k$pThen we'd decorate a tree and eat a\nhuge feast. When it got late, we'd\ngo around delivering presents...$k$pIt's hard to put presents next to\neveryone's pillows without waking\nthem up, you realize.$k$pWe're both tacticians, though, so I'm\nsure we could figure it out.$k$pIn fact, maybe we should brainstorm\nsome tactics before we begin. This is\nkind of exciting—a council of war!$k$pI've been looking forward to winter\never since I got here, you see...$k$pIf I got my wish, I'd spend the winter\nfestival with you for years to come!
