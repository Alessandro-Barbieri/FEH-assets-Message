Heroes Message Name: Message


MID_IKE_HOME1: The Heroes here are strong. Being\naround them makes me feel...$k$pHuh. Doesn't matter. I just need to\nget stronger.
MID_IKE_HOME2: I'm part of a group known as the\nGreil Mercenaries back in my world.\nThough I'm its leader...$k$pI wouldn't exactly say that I've got a\nhandle on our finances yet.
MID_IKE_HOME3: You worn out? Let me know if you\nare. I'll help, unless you think I'll\njust get in your way.
MID_IKE_HOME4: I train when I can, though usually by\nmyself. I'm not all that great when\nit comes to...you know, talk.
MID_IKE_HOME5: I'd spar with my father a lot during\npractice when I was younger.$k$pI'd lose every time. Get upset.\nThen take him on again.
MID_IKE_FRIEND: Are you the leader here? In any\ncase, I've come with greetings\nfrom $Nf.
MID_IKE_LEVEL1: Feels good to have a surge like\nthat. Real good!
MID_IKE_LEVEL2: I must get stronger. I must\navenge my father.
MID_IKE_LEVEL3: I'll never match his level of\nability at this rate...
MID_IKE_SKILL: You have my gratitude. I swear to\nrepay this debt.
MID_IKE_JOIN: I'm Ike of the Greil Mercenaries.\nYou the one hiring me? Fine. I'm\nready to get to work.
MID_IKE_STRONGEST: Back when my father was teaching\nme how to use a sword, I was\nbarely more than a boy.$k$pEvery training battle was more\nfrustrating than the last. I...I just\nstruggled with it constantly.$k$pThen he died.$k$pI had to protect my sister, the\nGreil Mercenaries, everyone that\nhe did...it was all on me.$k$pBut I was told to use what I'd\nbeen given. If I did, then great\nthings would happen.$k$pThat really stuck with me. Now\nhere I am, fighting in battles\nwith real Heroes.$k$pAnd I'm battling enemies that are\nsometimes stronger than I am.\nDo I really have a place here?$k$pBut you hired me—rolled the dice\nthat I might help you do great\nthings here.$k$pSo...right. Let's just cut this short\nthere. You believed in me, so I'm\nglad to give my all for you.
