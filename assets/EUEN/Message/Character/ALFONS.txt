MID_ALFONS_HOME1: I advise you not to get close to the\nHeroes. It will just make it harder...\nshould you ever be parted.
MID_ALFONS_HOME2: Some of our kingdom's subjects\nobjected when I joined this order.\nBut I wanted to do my part.$k$pStill, there are others who say that I\ndon't behave quite like a prince\nought to anyway.

MID_ALFONS_STRONGEST: I have to confess that I never\nintended to become friends with\nyou, Summoner.$k$pBut you're always there when I need\nyou, to the extent that when you're\nnot near, I feel...not quite myself.$k$pIt's a delicate position to be in.\nThe more you have to lose, the\nworse it hurts when you do.$k$pOthers may open themselves to\nsuch hurt, but as a prince,\nI must remain strong.$k$pIt seemed reasonable to keep\neveryone at a distance. But you've\nshown me the folly of that.$k$pI would have never discovered\nour fine friendship, had I not\nwelcomed you in.$k$pAnd then what would I be?\nLess than I am. Now, I can only\nhope you feel the same.$k$pIn any case, I swear to keep you\nsafe. You're my trusted partner,\n$Nu.
