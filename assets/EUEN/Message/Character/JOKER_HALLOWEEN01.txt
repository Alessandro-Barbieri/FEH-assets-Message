MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_HOME1: I suppose this outfit must make me\nlook quite intimidating. The other\nHeroes don't often approach me.$k$pI'm not complaining, mind you. It\nmeans I needn't bother with social\nniceties, after all.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_HOME2: Being in costume reminds me of a\nNohrian festival I once attended. So\nmany people, talking and talking...$k$pLooking back on it now, though... I\nmust admit it wasn't all that bad.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_HOME3: What's this? You'd like some candy?\nI suppose there are some things even\na summoner can't summon.$k$pVery well. I shall prepare some candy\nfor you in the near future.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_HOME4: Would you like to carve a pumpkin\nlantern with me? It might be fun—$k$pI mean, it might be more efficient if\nwe cooperated to complete the task.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_HOME5: It is said that costumes like this one\nare worn to frighten thieves so they\nwon't steal newly harvested crops.$k$pThat...is not my job, however. My\nduty is to protect my liege, Corrin.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_FRIEND: If you do not hand over some candy, I\nwill be left with no choice but to play\na very wicked trick on you.$k$pI jest, of course. I've simply come to\ngreet you, so I chose the traditional\nharvest festival style.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_LEVEL1: Have I been swept up in the spirit\nof the festival? How unlike me.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_LEVEL2: I have proven I can serve my\nliege no matter how I am attired.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_LEVEL3: Hmph. This would not be an issue,\nwere I wearing my uniform.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_SKILL: Do you truly intend to make me a\nmonster with this power?
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_JOIN: Happy harvest festival! I am Jakob, a\nbutler from Nohr. For my liege, I'll don\nany costume that's required.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_STRONGEST: Is that you, my liege? Oh, no...\nOf course not. It's you. How could\nI make such a mistake?$k$pPerhaps it is this costume. I feel as\nthough I've been a bit off since I\narrived at this castle.$k$pNormally, I would serve only my liege,\nCorrin. For some reason, however,\nI feel compelled to follow you...$k$pI fight for you, and even care about\nyour safety. I simply cannot\nunderstand it.$k$pAha! You've played a vicious trick on\nme, because I haven't given you any\ncandy. No? You haven't? Then...$k$pI must have formed some affection for\nyou myself, without even realizing...$k$pWell, when next we meet, the least I\ncould do would be to offer you a cup\nof tea, I suppose.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE01: ふんっ
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE02: それっ
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE03: うあっ
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE04: You're good...
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE05: Trick or treat?
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE06: No more of this trickery!
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE07: Time to reap the harvest!
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE08: Feast upon pumpkin!
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE09: I'll haunt you.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE10: Heh heh...
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE11: Care for a cup of tea? I've prepared it...with pumpkin.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE12: I am masquerading as a monster drawn from Nohrian legend.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE13: Trick or treat? I have no use for these candy-swapping charades. Or for your trickery.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE14: I would gladly serve sweets to my liege, Corrin. But treats? To children? The nerve.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE15: Believe you me, monsters are not half as ghastly as...people.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE16: Do the people of Askr also cavort around in costumes for the harvest festival?
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE17: Was that a pat on the back for a job well done? Or more trickery? Ah, well, even my liege Corrin would... Oh, never you mind.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE18: Indeed.
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE19: Round we go.\n\n
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE20: Trickery, eh?
MID_JOKER_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE21: I wore this at my master's behest.
