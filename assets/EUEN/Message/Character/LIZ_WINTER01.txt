MID_LIZ_WINTER01_HOME1: Alfonse is every inch the prince. I bet\nhe'd look great dressed up for the\nwinter festival!$k$pI kind of doubt he breaks training\ndummies or puts holes in the wall,\nlike another prince I could mention...
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_HOME2: When the winter festival is on, the\ncastle town is filled with stalls selling\nall sorts of delicious treats...$k$pWell, if you twisted my arm, I'd say I\nlike the ones selling sweets the best.
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_HOME3: I wish I had been able to bring along\nsome winter festival dishes to share\nwith everyone here.$k$pThen again, not everybody has a\ntaste for roast bear—me included.\nWhat about you?
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_HOME4: Look at this! It's a book full of songs\nwe sing during the winter festival.\nWant to sing together? Come on!
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_HOME5: Aww, I was just in the middle of\nsetting up a winter prank.$k$pNow that I said that, I guess you'd\nfigure out who dumped snow down\nyour back, huh?
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_FRIEND: I bring winter festival greetings! From\nme, of course, and also from your\nfriend $Nf!
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_LEVEL1: Woo-hoo! The gods gave me a\ngift for being such a good girl!
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_LEVEL2: A little excitement to spice up the\nwinter festival!
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_LEVEL3: If I want a present, I probably\nshould behave a bit better.
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_SKILL: A gift for me? Why, thank you!
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_JOIN: Happy winter festival! My name's\nLissa. What do you think of this\ndress? It's bright red—for the festival.
MID_LIZ_WINTER01_STRONGEST: Hey there! I've been waiting for you.\nTa-da! It's your present! Hurry up and\nopen it!$k$pAre you kidding me? This is not a\n"bottle of some random liquid." That's\njust plain rude.$k$pI'll have you know that we always\nserve this during the winter festival.$k$pThough, er...it does look a tad off.\nI'm not sure what I got wrong...$k$pIt's the thought that counts, though.\nRight? I just wanted to thank you for\nbeing such a great friend.$k$pBottoms up, you say? Well...thanks!$k$pEr... How...is it?$k$pYou don't look so good...$k$pSomebody! Anybody! I need a staff!\nQUICK!
