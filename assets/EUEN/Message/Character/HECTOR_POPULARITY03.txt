MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_HOME1: Uther... I wish I could have been at\nyour side to aid you, Brother...
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_HOME2: This here is the freezing lance Maltet.\nJust like Armads, it's counted among\nthe legendary weapons of Elibe.$k$pThat said, wielding it is quite different\nfrom wielding an axe...
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_HOME3: Don't get too close. One wrong step\nand this heavy armor could crush you\nflat. Hahaha! I'm only joking, friend!$k$pDo be careful around me, though...
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_HOME4: Daily training is essential if you want\nto move around in heavy armor like\nthis. Care to join me?$k$pOnce you get used to being sore all\nthe time, it's actually quite fun!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_HOME5: Hey, what's with that strange look\nyou're giving me? Oh, this? It's just a\nbook.$k$pWhat?! Aw, come on. I read! A lord\nhas to have some refinement!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_FRIEND: I'm Hector, Marquess of Ostia. And\nI've brought you a message from\n$Nf.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_LEVEL1: Heh, I couldn't lose right now if I\ntried!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_LEVEL2: I think I'm finally getting the hang of\nthis lance.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_LEVEL3: Ugh... This armor sure is heavy...
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_SKILL: Oho! Thanks, friend! I'll pay you back\nlike I always do—on the battlefield!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_JOIN: I'm Hector, Marquess of Ostia. I was\nwondering why I was called here,\nbut...$k$pWell, if you have some foes that need\nrouting, I have just the lance for the\njob.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_STRONGEST: Hey, let me ask you a question...\nWhat qualities do you suppose are\nmost important for a ruler to have?$k$pI've been thinking about this since I\nsucceeded the throne. And aside\nfrom bravery, I'm at a total loss...$k$pThe respect of the people, you say?\nHm... Without the backing of the\npeople, one isn't qualified to rule...$k$pYes, I think that makes good sense.$k$pHowever, respect is not something\nyou can see with your eyes.$k$pHuh? Seeing isn't always believing?\nThere you go again, doling out\nwisdom faster than I can keep up!$k$pWell, if that's the expectation set for\nme as a ruler, then I'll just have to\nmeet it.$k$pFor those who have put their faith in\nme...and for my brother.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE01: せいっ！
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE02: いくぜっ！
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE04: まだまだ…！
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE05: Prepare to die!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE06: Clear a path!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE07: Your luck's run out!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE08: Pierce the sky, Maltet!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE09: Uther... I...
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE10: うーむ
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE11: This here is heavy armor from House Ostia. And let me tell you, they don't call it "heavy" for nothing!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE12: Who was that? This bulky armor makes it so hard to move. Normally I'm lighter on my feet, I swear!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE13: Get this. "For generations, Corrupt neither the body nor the mind has been the dominant ideology of Ostia."
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE14: My brother Uther was the Marquess of Ostia. He was a great man... Someone you could truly respect.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE15: My dream was to one day grow wiser so I could sit at my brother's side and aid him.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE16: I never asked it of him, but... Even on the verge of death, he watched over me.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE17: You're not dying while I'm around. Not a chance.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE18: Right.
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE19: I'm up next!
MID_HECTOR_POPULARITY03_VOICE20: One step at a time.
