MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_HOME1: What do I want out of my marriage?\nI'd be happiest knowing the person I\nlove is also happy.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_HOME2: A member of the royal guard often\ntook to wearing some odd outfits...\nThey'd doubtless love this one.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_HOME3: Jagen, Cain, Abel, Draug, and\nGordin... I can't help but wonder what\nthey'd say if they saw me in this outfit.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_HOME4: I heard that Caeda attended a bridal\nfestival a little while ago. It sounds like\nshe had a wonderful time.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_HOME5: I'm not quite used to fighting on\nhorseback.$k$pI'll need the Altean knights to teach\nme how to simultaneously wield my\nweapon and control my horse.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_FRIEND: I come with greetings of affection\nfrom $Nf. May\nyou always be happy.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_LEVEL1: Ha, what a surprise! Could this\nbe the power of love?
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_LEVEL2: I must become stronger to protect\nthose I love.

MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_SKILL: Why, thank you! It's like a\ncelebration is just for me.
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_JOIN: Greetings. I am Prince Marth of Altea.\nThis outfit? It's a traditional groom's\noutfit for a bridal festival, in which...$k$pWell... It's a bit hard to explain,\nyou see...
MID_MARTH_BRIDE02_STRONGEST: I've been told this outfit is what a man\nwears when pledging his love to the\nwoman he loves.$k$pIn my heart, I already know the\nwoman I want by my side when I\nmake such a vow, but...$k$pWell, dressing in this outfit and\nthinking about making such vows\nsomehow...makes me nervous.$k$pHa, I suppose wearing this has been\ngood practice. Now that I know how it\nfeels, I'll be ready for the real thing.$k$pAnd when that day comes, I'd be\nhonored to have you bear witness,\n$Nu.
