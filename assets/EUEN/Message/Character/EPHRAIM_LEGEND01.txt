MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_HOME1: Legendary Hero? Am I really so\npraiseworthy?$k$pI have a feeling the stories that are\ntold about me tend to omit my thirst\nfor battle.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_HOME2: Eirika is my twin sister. We've always\nbeen together, ever since we were\nborn. Well, actually, even before that.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_HOME3: People criticize my fighting style—\n"reckless," they call me! Call me\nthat when I lose—because I won't.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_HOME4: Studying books is so very tedious...\nI could only make my way through\nthem with help from my friend Lyon.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_HOME5: I have a lot of experience fighting on\nhorseback. I'm interested in anything\nthat'll give me the edge in battle.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_FRIEND: I'm Ephraim. Would you be willing to\nspar with me? I want to get the\nmeasure of the army you have here.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_LEVEL1: I will be king, and defend the\npeople with my own two hands.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_LEVEL2: The lessons I've learned in battle\ngive me strength.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_LEVEL3: It's just a little bad luck. Why\nworry? On to the next battle.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_SKILL: I must steel my will, so that power\nwill never lead me astray.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_JOIN: I am Prince Ephraim of Renais. You\nsay I'm a...legendary Hero?$k$pI was only able to defeat the Demon\nKing thanks to all those who lent their\nstrength to me.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEGEND01_STRONGEST: Thanks to your ability to summon\nHeroes, you've been thrust into the\nposition of a leader.$k$pThat power is truly profound. It has\nthe potential to shake the worlds.$k$pYou should consider the impact you\ncould make. What foe could possibly\nbe beyond your grasp?$k$pI know that's a strange thought, but\nI've pondered this for a long time...$k$pYou see, I'm drawn to battle. The\nstronger I get, the more I want to fight.\nI'm driven to test myself.$k$pI know that's just how I am. But I also\nrealize that this is not a healthy\nimpulse for a king.$k$pPeople here call me a Legendary\nHero, and sing my praises...$k$pThey say that I am a good king,\none who has vowed to protect his\npeople.$k$pI will become king, one day. And\nthough I am not yet that man, I hope\nto be. And I will protect my people...$k$pNot just them. My friend also hoped\nto save his people, and I will protect\nthem, too...$k$pMy goal is to be a king beyond\nkings—one who breaks the bounds\nof human frailty.$k$pI hope I can reach that goal one day.
