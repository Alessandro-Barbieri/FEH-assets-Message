MID_CLARINE_HOME1: You may correct me if I'm wrong, but\nyou seem to know a bit of etiquette.\nDid you learn it where you're from?
MID_CLARINE_HOME2: I shall be a beautiful Mage General\nlike Lady Cecilia in due time. Oh, if\nonly my brother could see that day!
MID_CLARINE_HOME3: Oh! On close inspection, you look\ntwice as nice as I thought. But if you\ntake a look at me, you'll see that I—$k$pHey, are you listening to me?!
MID_CLARINE_HOME4: I am infinitely busy, of course, but I\nalways have time for you. But, please,\ndo me a favor and make it quick.
MID_CLARINE_HOME5: How to properly do this or that, such\nas wearing fashions or dancing...\nWhy, it's all a cinch for me.
MID_CLARINE_FRIEND: Ah. May I presume you to be\n$Nu?$k$pYou have the great honor of\nreceiving a greeting from me,\nin person.
MID_CLARINE_LEVEL1: It's only natural that I sparkle so!
MID_CLARINE_LEVEL2: I come from a fine bloodline, so\nthis is only expected.
MID_CLARINE_LEVEL3: What, nothing more? But that's\npreposterous!
MID_CLARINE_SKILL: A fine lady must sparkle in both\nstrength and style.
MID_CLARINE_JOIN: I am Clarine, the very talented\ndaughter of Count Reglay of Etruria.\nAnd who, may I ask, are you?
MID_CLARINE_STRONGEST: My word! Is it just me, or is nearly\nevery single person here sorely\nlacking in etiquette?$k$pI don't mean you, of course.\nNever you—for I have the sort of\nmanners never to say so!$k$pBut I must risk offense and tell\nyou the truth. People look to\nyou to set a higher standard.$k$pWhat? They do! All are quite aware\nthat if we don't use our napkins\nproperly, it will be anarchy!$k$pSo, because I am grateful for\neverything that you do, I will take\nyou on as a special project.$k$pYou'll have manners coming out\nyour ears by the time I'm finished\nwith you. Won't this be fun?
