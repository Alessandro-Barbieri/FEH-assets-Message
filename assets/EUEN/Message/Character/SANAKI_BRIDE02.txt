MID_SANAKI_BRIDE02_HOME2: I hear that wedding ceremonies\nfeature all manner of fancy banquets,\nbut the bride has no time to eat.$k$pIsn't that just tragic? She is the star of\nthe wedding, after all.

So my wedding, too, will be\ndifferent from the common person's.$k$pMy groom will not be chosen based\nupon feelings alone.$k$pHowever, I think my desire to be with\nsomeone I love... Is the same as any\nother person's...$k$pSpending this time with you has\nallowed me to realize this. And\nsomeday, when I, too...$k$pH-hey, you better not tell anyone I'm\ntelling you all this!
