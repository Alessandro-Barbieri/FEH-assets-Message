MID_KARLA_HOME1: Karel... Even if things can never\nagain be how they were... I must\nkeep going.
MID_KARLA_HOME2: Only one can wield the sword of our\nclan. Aside from my brother, all have\nfallen... As will I, someday.$k$pAnd yet...here I am.
MID_KARLA_HOME3: Your diligence is worthy of respect.\nTake care not to overtax yourself,\nhowever.
MID_KARLA_HOME4: I have seen much on my journey, but\nthe sights here are rare indeed. Do\nyou have the time to be my guide?
MID_KARLA_HOME5: Saw me training, did you? You might\nthink I have no need to, but the habit\nis ingrained deep within me.
MID_KARLA_FRIEND: I am called Karla, and I have come to\ndeliver greetings. You have a friend in\n$Nf.
MID_KARLA_LEVEL1: My body feels so light. Is this what\nit means to wield a sword?

MID_KARLA_LEVEL3: I have fallen short...
MID_KARLA_SKILL: What strength... Thank you. I will\nmake use of this.
MID_KARLA_JOIN: I am Karla. This place is very\nstrange... Who might you be?
MID_KARLA_STRONGEST: My clan lives by the sword. Our lives\nare spent improving our skills and\nslaying our foes.$k$pEven our kin fall to our blades...$k$pAfter leaving the plains, I came to\nrealize that this is not the only form\nstrength takes.$k$pA sword is just a sword.$k$pOne man showed me how to truly\nbecome stronger...$k$pMy brother has also realized that\nthe way of the sword is not merely\nkilling others.$k$pAnd after spending some time\nobserving you, I have seen a new\nkind of strength.$k$pHow can I describe it? It is a strength\nhoned by choosing not to fight.$k$pI find it fascinating.$k$pUntil I can fully understand it... I will\nstay by your side.

MID_KARLA_VOICE11: Only one can wield the sword. That is the law of our clan.
MID_KARLA_VOICE12: Hm? You took advantage of an opening. I imagine you will have no complaint if I do the same.
MID_KARLA_VOICE13: I set out traveling to find my brother. I felt...attached to him. I still can’t seem to let go...
MID_KARLA_VOICE14: My brother gravitates toward strong warriors...
MID_KARLA_VOICE15: We are not human... We are no different than this blade.
MID_KARLA_VOICE16: If I could, I would have stayed that way forever. Brother...
