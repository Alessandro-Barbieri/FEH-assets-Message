MID_OPHELIA_HOME1: So you're the Summoner, huh? The\nGreat Hero, the only one of your kind\nacross all realms...$k$pAwww! That makes you sound like a\nchosen one! I'm so jealous!
MID_OPHELIA_HOME2: I grew up in the great sea of stars, a\nrealm otherwise known as the\nDeeprealms.$k$pI wasn't able to see my parents very\noften, so I prayed to the stars that\nthey were safe.
MID_OPHELIA_HOME3: I just came up with an amazing new\nspell! I jotted it down in my spell\ndiary. Um... Huh... What page again?
MID_OPHELIA_HOME4: Will you take me to that majestic gate\nthat transcends worlds?$k$pI mean the summoning ruins of\ncourse. Just the thought of that place\nmakes my maiden heart flutter!
MID_OPHELIA_HOME5: Oh, I was just polishing a holy stone.$k$pJust as prophetic words will not\nreach a stagnant heart, the twinkle of\nstars will not reside in a cloudy stone.
MID_OPHELIA_FRIEND: Just as the same light can reach\ndifferent kingdoms, prophecies can\nreach different worlds.$k$pAnd this prophecy is a greeting\nto you!
MID_OPHELIA_LEVEL1: I hope you're watching, Father!
MID_OPHELIA_LEVEL2: I can feel the light of the stars.\nOnly natural for a chosen one.
MID_OPHELIA_LEVEL3: Aww, I was hoping to get stronger\nin a jiffy!
MID_OPHELIA_SKILL: Sparkling power wells up inside\nme... Ophelia Dusk is reborn!
MID_OPHELIA_JOIN: I am Ophelia, a warrior chosen by the\nstars. I suppose I should say it's good\nto meet you. Tell me...$k$pDoes my father Odin make this fair\nland his home?
MID_OPHELIA_STRONGEST: I was searching for you—the chosen\none born to bear the title of\nSummoner.$k$pToday, I confer a sparkle unto you!\nTa-daaa! This is the sacred stone of\nfriendship!$k$pI found it soon after coming to this\nworld. It's the exact same color as\nyour eyes!$k$pI thought it would make a good gift,\nso I polished it bit by bit—on days we\nchatted or days we battled together.$k$pThose memories twinkle like the\nstars, and now they're in this stone.$k$pIn other words, it's sparkly enough to\nbe worthy of being called a sacred\nstone!$k$pThat's why now is the perfect time to\ngive it to you.$k$pI hope you'll give this stone a good\nname. It sparkles because you've\nmade so many memories with me.$k$pAnd I also hope that we'll always get\nalong this well, for the rest of time.
