MID_MARKS_BON01_HOME1: As Crown Prince of Nohr, it wouldn't\ndo for me to be seen dancing without\nthe grace that befits my station...
MID_MARKS_BON01_HOME2: So this is Hoshido's summer festival...\nThe rumors did not do it justice—it's\nmore intriguing than anticipated.
MID_MARKS_BON01_HOME3: Are you certain you don't want to\njoin in? To tell you the truth...I, too,\nwas unsure at first.$k$pIf you try it yourself, I think you'll\nfind what is so wonderful about the\ndance.
MID_MARKS_BON01_HOME4: Nohr and Hoshido were once locked\nin a bitter war with each other. Battle\nafter battle raged on, no end in sight.$k$pLook how far we've come... Now we\nare here, together, hand in hand.
MID_MARKS_BON01_HOME5: I must tell my siblings about the joys\nof this dance! I'm certain they would\nenjoy it, given the opportunity.
MID_MARKS_BON01_FRIEND: I bring greetings from\n$Nf! Curious\nabout my outfit, are you?$k$pIt's traditional Hoshidan garb! I'm told\nit's considered sacred in their culture.
MID_MARKS_BON01_LEVEL1: With practice comes skill!\nObserve!
MID_MARKS_BON01_LEVEL2: Adequate... Is my adherence to\ndecorum holding me back?
MID_MARKS_BON01_LEVEL3: Hmph. Am I failing to perform the\nsteps properly? I must focus...
MID_MARKS_BON01_SKILL: You have my thanks. Now my\ndancing can reach new heights!
MID_MARKS_BON01_JOIN: I am Xander, Crown Prince of Nohr.\nI've long heard rumors of the dances\nof the Hoshidan summer festival.$k$pIf I may, allow me to join in.
MID_MARKS_BON01_STRONGEST: Many chronicles of the past describe\nthe history of humankind as one of\nwar.$k$pGiven my experience, the sentiment\nrings true to me.$k$pBut could it be that we exist solely to\nfight and kill one another? I do not\nbelieve so.$k$pSometimes we can come together in\ncelebration, link hands, and step\nforward into the future.$k$pAll the proof I need is in the smiling\nfaces of the people joining in the\nsummer festival's celebrations.$k$pIn their eyes, borders and nations do\nnot exist. Here, there is no division\nbetween Hoshido and Nohr.$k$pThe festival brings people together,\nuniting us as one... I pray that peace\nlike this can endure forever.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE01: よっ！
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE02: ほっ！
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE03: うあああっ！
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE04: 無粋な…！
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE05: Dance!
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE06: Time to celebrate!
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE07: You lack passion!
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE08: The festival begins!
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE09: The dance isn't over…
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE10: Ha ha ha!
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE11: I shall dance!
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE12: Let the dance begin.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE13: Hoshidan yukata are surprisingly functional. They're light, and they do not restrict movement.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE14: What's the matter? Am I wearing my yukata incorrectly?
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE15: This dance is surprisingly difficult to get just right.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE16: Each kingdom has its own festivals. We can learn much about a culture by participating ourselves, no?
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE17: I hope that you and I can spend the summer festival side by side.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE18: Very well.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE19: Summer. Hmm.
MID_MARKS_BON01_VOICE20: Watch my technique.
