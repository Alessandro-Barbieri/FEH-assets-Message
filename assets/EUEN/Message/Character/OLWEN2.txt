MID_OLWEN2_HOME1: Sometimes, I lose my temper... One\ntime, I even pointed my sword at a\nsuperior officer.$k$pMy brother would have been quite\ndisappointed, had he heard about it.
MID_OLWEN2_HOME2: Lady Ishtar trusts my brother\nimplicitly. That hasn't made Lord\nJulius very fond of him, however.
MID_OLWEN2_HOME3: I've taken my magical studies in a\nnew direction.$k$pI may yet be inexperienced, but that's\nliberating. I don't worry about\nconsequences—I just get on with it.
MID_OLWEN2_HOME4: My brother is proud, but he is also\nvery kind. I expect he would sacrifice\nhimself if it meant saving me...
MID_OLWEN2_HOME5: Someday, I'd like to have a child...\nEr, no... It's not like I have a father in\nmind!
MID_OLWEN2_FRIEND: Pardon the intrusion. I'm Olwen, and\nI'm delivering this greeting in place of\n$Nf.
MID_OLWEN2_LEVEL1: I'm doing well, aren't I? That\nis very satisfying.
MID_OLWEN2_LEVEL2: I'll continue to walk my own path,\none step at a time.
MID_OLWEN2_LEVEL3: I am sorry that I have failed you.
MID_OLWEN2_SKILL: This new power you've given\nme... I will not squander it.
MID_OLWEN2_JOIN: My name is Olwen. If you'll allow it, I'd\nbe happy to demonstrate the magic\nI've been studying recently.
MID_OLWEN2_STRONGEST: I turned my back on my country. From\nthen on, I swore to walk my own path,\nno matter the consequences.$k$pEven if I were to be killed because of\nmy decision...so be it. That is the way\nthings must be.$k$pThough we've rarely spoken, I have\nobserved the conviction in your eyes.$k$pThat conviction is so strong it feels as\nthough it might consume me...$k$pIt seems your belief in the path you\nare traveling is unshakable. I hope to\nfind that kind of confidence in myself.$k$pI am proud to walk alongside you. I\nhope you will allow me to continue to\naccompany you on your journey.
