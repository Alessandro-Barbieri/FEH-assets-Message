MID_CHROM2_HOME1: Seems it's past time that I start my\ndaily training. If I slack off, somebody\nwill scold me—I just know it.
MID_CHROM2_HOME2: I like to keep my feet firmly planted\non the ground. But the view from\nthis guy's back is nice, too...$k$pFeel that breeze!
MID_CHROM2_HOME3: What's on your mind? You have that\nlook about you...$k$pHow about a race to that hill over\nthere? Fresh air always helps me\nblow away the cobwebs.
MID_CHROM2_HOME4: Hm? This apple? Well...I was going to\ngive it to my buddy here, but it looked\nso good...$k$pWant a bite? Go ahead, don't be shy!
MID_CHROM2_HOME5: If it isn't $Nu!\nI'm grooming my horse. Go ahead and\npet him! He won't bite.
MID_CHROM2_FRIEND: So this is your castle, is it,\n$Nu?$k$pIt's just as impressive as\n$Nf's is.
MID_CHROM2_LEVEL1: We will tame the chaos. Gather\nunder my banner!
MID_CHROM2_LEVEL2: I vow here and now to set my\nsights on grander heights!
MID_CHROM2_LEVEL3: That's it? Really? Well, it's\nprobably my fault. Sorry!
MID_CHROM2_SKILL: On my honor, this power will\nbecome your strength, too!
MID_CHROM2_JOIN: I'm Chrom, prince of the Halidom of\nYlisse. That look on your face... Rest\neasy! I know how to handle a horse.
MID_CHROM2_STRONGEST: I've got a question for you. When\nsomebody says "knight," what does\nthat mean to you?$k$pSomeone noble—someone who\nwould sacrifice themselves for\ntheir allies. Hmm...$k$pA warrior who battles with pride and\nwho doesn't flinch in the face of\nbattle? I see.$k$pSo, that's not quite how I think about\nthings...$k$pThe willingness to sacrifice yourself to\nsave someone else is admirable,\ncertainly. Not everyone can do that.$k$pBut think about it... If you sacrifice\nyourself, you'll end up hurting the\npeople who care about you. Right?$k$pYeah, you got me. I'm talking about\nyou, $Nu.$k$pYou face some hard decisions. If you\nwant to protect others, you'd better\nprotect yourself first.$k$pWe can help each other. Let's talk\nabout our hardships and share our\nideals...$k$pWe're comrades, now. That bond\ncan't be broken—ever!

MID_CHROM2_VOICE11: Don't worry. I took a lesson on mounted combat a few years ago.
MID_CHROM2_VOICE12: Did you call for me?
MID_CHROM2_VOICE13: Mobility is one of the many strengths of being on horseback. If your friends need help, you can reach them in an instant.
MID_CHROM2_VOICE14: If you want to learn how to make friends with a horse, just ask Frederick. His best friend is a horse!
MID_CHROM2_VOICE15: Mastering different combat styles is sure to make me stronger.
MID_CHROM2_VOICE16: Now that I've been charging around on horseback, the amount of training dummies I've been able to break has increased nearly tenfold...
MID_CHROM2_VOICE17: If you're ever in trouble, just call for me. Wherever you are, I'll come running with the wind at my back.
MID_CHROM2_VOICE18: Be right there.
MID_CHROM2_VOICE19: What now?
MID_CHROM2_VOICE20: Here to help!
