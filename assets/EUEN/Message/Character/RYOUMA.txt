MID_RYOUMA_HOME1: This realm has a beauty so different\nfrom my own Hoshido. I would like to\nshow it to all my siblings someday.

Envision a relaxing place.$k$pI am thinking of Hoshido—cherry-\nblossom trees in bloom...rain in the\ngardens...a moon on the wane.$k$pI must admit that when I've been\nmeditating of late, I have also\nenvisioned something new.$k$pPlaces from this realm...the faces\nof members in the Order of\nHeroes...and, most of all...$k$pI see you, standing on the battlefield.\nThat image lets me achieve inner\nbalance like no other.$k$pI hope that you would feel just the\nsame from my presence here.$k$pOne more thing—in my own kingdom,\nI would never pledge my katana\nin service to another.$k$pBut here, it is my honor and my\nprivilege to serve you to the\nend with my blade.
