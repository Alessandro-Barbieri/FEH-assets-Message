MID_TURNER_HOME1: My brother is nobody's fool. But when\nit comes to Ephraim...well, that's the\nexception. He sees him as a rival.
MID_TURNER_HOME2: I left the castle without my father's\npermission. I wonder if he'll be angry\nwith me...
MID_TURNER_HOME3: How are you doing? Just let me know\nif you need something. That's what\nfriends are for, right?
MID_TURNER_HOME4: Come on! Let's get out of here! Show\nme a good time. After all, taking time\nout is important—even in war.$k$pIf you don't relax now and again, you'll\nsuffer for it.
MID_TURNER_HOME5: Outside of training? I spend my time\nmaking friends, I suppose...$k$pI just want to meet people who have\nthe same aspirations I do!
MID_TURNER_FRIEND: Hello, $Nu!$k$pThank you for being such a good\nfriend to $Nf!
MID_TURNER_LEVEL1: My brother will have no choice\nbut to acknowledge my skill now!
MID_TURNER_LEVEL2: I wish we could be more like\nEirika and Ephraim. Maybe now...
MID_TURNER_LEVEL3: I can just imagine what my\nbrother would say about this...
MID_TURNER_SKILL: I can hold my head high and fight\nalongside everyone! Thank you!
MID_TURNER_JOIN: My name is Tana, and I'm a pegasus\nknight.$k$pOh, and I'm also the princess of\nFrelia. I hope you won't let that get\nin the way of us being friends, though!
MID_TURNER_STRONGEST: I had seen so little of the world. But\nsomehow, when I left the castle, I\nthought I was ready...$k$pBut no. Coming here has simply\nshown me that there is so much that\nI don't yet understand.$k$pTraveling with you has opened my\neyes, though. I am sure of it.$k$pEirika is my best friend. Of that, I have\nno doubt. But you've become just\nas important to me.$k$pI love Eirika, Ephraim, and my brother\nwith all of my heart. And I feel the\nsame about you!

MID_TURNER_VOICE10: Heehee
MID_TURNER_VOICE11: Shall we chat? Yes? Lovely!
MID_TURNER_VOICE12: Aah! Please don't tease me like that.
MID_TURNER_VOICE13: My brother is so cruel. You should hear what he said to me.
MID_TURNER_VOICE14: I'm afraid I haven't been very much help to you.
MID_TURNER_VOICE15: I feel I should apologize. I'm still in training and not quite battle-ready.
MID_TURNER_VOICE16: Am I a little bit stronger now? I hope so...
