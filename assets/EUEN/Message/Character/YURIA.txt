MID_YURIA_HOME1: The Book of Naga...has always\nseemed both familiar...and\nmysterious.
MID_YURIA_HOME2: My mother and father...and my\nbrother Julius... They were all as\nkind as you can imagine.
MID_YURIA_HOME3: As always, thank you for all that\nyou do. Let me know if there's\nanything more I can do to help.
MID_YURIA_HOME4: Seliph...that is, my brother...is the\nsort of person who could lead a\nworld toward peace.$k$pAs are you, clearly.
MID_YURIA_HOME5: My brother Julius, once very kind,\nturned into a twisted devil...$k$pThen by that devil's hands, my\nmother...and my father... Oh, it's\nbeyond anything!
MID_YURIA_FRIEND: Ah. Sorry to be a bother, but\nI've found myself here and...\nWhere am I exactly?
MID_YURIA_LEVEL1: I will fight—no matter who our\nfoe!
MID_YURIA_LEVEL2: I want to grow stronger so I\ncan give my all.
MID_YURIA_LEVEL3: I won't take flight, no matter\nhow dire things may get.
MID_YURIA_SKILL: I grow closer to understanding\nthe reason I am here.
MID_YURIA_JOIN: My name is Julia—she who inherited\nthe ability to use the book of the\nDivine Dragon, Naga.
MID_YURIA_STRONGEST: My brother Julius and I both inherited\na special power through our lineage.$k$pI...gained the ability to use the\nBook of Naga.$k$pMy brother...could take hold of a\nbook of terrible darkness, and it turned\nhim into a devil of a man.$k$pBoth of our fates were made merely\nbecause of lineage.$k$pWhat if I could succumb to what took\nhold of my brother—become your\nworst enemy against my will?$k$pThe thought terrifies me. But I take\nheart in one thing—how you have\ncontinued to be there for me.$k$pI believe, were that to happen, that\none word from you would bring\nme back to my senses.$k$pI ask you to never leave my side, so\nthat I...can never leave yours.
