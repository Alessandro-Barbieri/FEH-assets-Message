MID_CHROM_HOME1: Seeing you and Alfonse together\nreminds me of the time I've spent\nwith a friend of mine...
MID_CHROM_HOME2: Back home, my Shepherds deal with\noutlaws and monsters. It's strange\nthat here we battle against Heroes.
MID_CHROM_HOME3: Keeping watch? Your dedication\nreminds me of a certain tactician.\nDon't push yourself too hard!
MID_CHROM_HOME4: Care to spar? Or perhaps we could\njust work on self-defense drills so\nI don't break anything...
MID_CHROM_HOME5: I was practicing my swing and\nwound up smashing a pot. Forgive\nme, $Nu.
MID_CHROM_FRIEND: Ah, are you the master of this\ncastle? I bring warm regards\nfrom $Nf.
MID_CHROM_LEVEL1: No one can stop me now!
MID_CHROM_LEVEL2: My strength comes from\ndiligence.
MID_CHROM_LEVEL3: Well, that was underwhelming.
MID_CHROM_SKILL: I vow to use the power you grant\nme wisely and well.
MID_CHROM_JOIN: I'm Chrom, leader of the Shepherds\nand Prince of the Halidom of Ylisse.\nFor my friends...for peace...I'll fight.
MID_CHROM_STRONGEST: It seems like a lot of time has\npassed since you and I first met.\nAt first I was bewildered, but...$k$pyour guidance has made me\nstronger. May we ever remain\nside by side.$k$pYou know, when I first met you,\nyou reminded me a lot of Robin.$k$pNot just your manner, but the way\nyou plan, help everyone, and work\nto keep all of your allies alive.$k$pThere is no one I'd rather have\nguiding my steps. This bond we've\nbuilt will last forever.\n

MID_CHROM_VOICE14: I hope things are well in Ylisse...
MID_CHROM_VOICE15: I miss the advice of my tactician.
MID_CHROM_VOICE16: Damn it... Broke another training dummy...
