MID_DOHGA_HOME1: Why don't you wear armor? Seems\ndangerous. Those odd clothes you\nwear can't protect you, you know.
MID_DOHGA_HOME2: I'm an Altean knight. I wear this\nheavy armor of mine so I can\nprotect Prince Marth.
MID_DOHGA_HOME3: You always seem so busy—are you\ntaking time to relax? You shouldn't\npush yourself.
MID_DOHGA_HOME4: I'd feel a lot better if you wore\nheavy armor like me, but...you might\nnot be able to move if you did!
MID_DOHGA_HOME5: Hmm... Lately I feel like my armor\ndoesn't fit quite right...
MID_DOHGA_FRIEND: Excuse me. Are you in charge?\nI've come to deliver a greeting\nfrom $Nf.
MID_DOHGA_LEVEL1: Soon I'll be the ultimate protector!
MID_DOHGA_LEVEL2: Very nice. This will toughen up\nmy defenses.
MID_DOHGA_LEVEL3: Got to train harder if I’m going to\nprotect everyone!
MID_DOHGA_SKILL: Now I can protect even more of\nour allies.
MID_DOHGA_JOIN: I'm Draug, an Altean knight.\nMy armor and I will stand between\nour enemies and our allies.
