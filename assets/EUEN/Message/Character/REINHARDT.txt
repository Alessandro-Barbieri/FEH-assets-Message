MID_REINHARDT_HOME1: Prince Alfonse and Princess\nSharena seem to be quite close.\nThat brings back memories...
MID_REINHARDT_HOME2: It was my duty for many years to\nprotect Queen Ishtar of my world.\nI took my duty very seriously.
MID_REINHARDT_HOME3: Please take care of yourself. This\ngroup would be doomed if it lost\nyour keen sense of tactics.
MID_REINHARDT_HOME4: My sister, Olwen, more than grew up\nwhen I wasn't looking—she became\nformidable in her own right.
MID_REINHARDT_HOME5: There was a tactician so brilliant in\nmy world that he was thought of as\na god that presided over war.$k$pI must say, your command is\nperhaps as impeccable.
MID_REINHARDT_FRIEND: Excuse my sudden appearance.\nMy name is Reinhardt. I bring\ngreetings as a sign of friendship.
MID_REINHARDT_LEVEL1: Better than expected. I should\nalways focus this much.
MID_REINHARDT_LEVEL2: At this rate, I may achieve\nwhat I must.
MID_REINHARDT_LEVEL3: Such a failing. Am I losing my\nconviction?
MID_REINHARDT_SKILL: This is an honor. In thanks, I pledge\nto prevail in battle.
MID_REINHARDT_JOIN: I am Reinhardt of Friege. Allow\nme to unleash havoc on your\nenemies with my thunder magic.
MID_REINHARDT_STRONGEST: When I was young, my young sister,\nOlwen, followed me everywhere.$k$pAs her elder brother, I felt it my\nduty to guide her path in life,\nhelping her at every turn.$k$pBut I now realize I wasn't doing it\njust for Olwen, nor was I even\nleading as much as I thought.$k$pIt was more like she and I each\nhad our own path, though\nequally high standards.$k$pYou have helped me understand\nthat at last. You and I—different,\nyet fully committed.$k$pWhat an ideal way to grow—neither\nleading nor following, but walking\ntogether. I thank you.

MID_REINHARDT_VOICE11: Tell me. What are your orders?
MID_REINHARDT_VOICE12: Come now! No more of that.
MID_REINHARDT_VOICE13: You have quite a skill for battle tactics.
MID_REINHARDT_VOICE14: I knew a brilliant tactician named Saias. You may be his superior.
MID_REINHARDT_VOICE15: I have a younger sister named Olwen. Do you have any siblings?
