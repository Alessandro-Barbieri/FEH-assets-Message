MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_HOME1: Ha. You fight for world peace? Stay\nyour tongue. Such pretty little words\nsicken me.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_HOME2: My mind becomes muddy when I try\nto recall certain things... A side effect\nof traveling through space and time?$k$pCurse this frail body.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_HOME3: You fight for the happiness of all the\npeople in this world? Hahaha, tell\nme...$k$pDid you come up with that little motto\nall by yourself? Go on, you can tell\nme what your heart truly desires.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_HOME4: You show promise, despite being\nhuman. If you continue to appease\nme, I may let you serve me.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_HOME5: Rite after rite, and still my memories\nrefuse to return. This is beyond\ninfuriating...$k$pMaybe I'll go start a war to cheer\nmyself up.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_FRIEND: I've come to play on behalf of\n$Nf. Though,\nyou may find me... Arbitrary at times.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_LEVEL1: Beware, lowly worms. I shall show\nyou how to wield true power!
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_LEVEL2: This power should suffice for\nstomping mere worms.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_LEVEL3: Hmph. Exterminating lowly\nhumans hardly requires power.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_SKILL: This power surpasses that of the\ngods. I will bring destruction...
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_JOIN: I am the wings of despair. I am the\nbreath of ruin. I am the fell dragon,\nGrima.$k$pPay me the respect I am due, and I\npromise you a painless death.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_STRONGEST: You are a curious one... You willingly\ncome to chat with me? The fell\ndragon? Alone?$k$pYou know full well how I detest\nhumans.$k$pThey have no qualms asking for\ndivine assistance when it meets their\nfickle needs...$k$pBut how quick they are to shun their\nbenefactors once they get what they\ndesire.$k$pThey become arrogant and make the\nsame mistakes repeatedly, incapable\nof learning the folly of their ways.$k$pThey claim their actions are for the\ngood of others, but that's merely a\nshow of self-indulgence.$k$pHumans are selfish. And the ugliness\nof mankind has turned me repulsive.$k$pIt's the world that wants me to be evil.\nAnd yet you claim to need me here?\nEnough of your lies, worm.$k$pHow dare you look at me with such a\ngaze. Do not dare pity me!

MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_VOICE13: I seem to have lost some of my memories when I crossed the skies.
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_VOICE14: How odd... I sense something...familiar about you...
MID_REFLET_M_DARK01_VOICE15: If you can help me regain my memories... I shall spare your life.
