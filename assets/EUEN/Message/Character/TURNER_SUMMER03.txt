MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_HOME1: I'm loving this weather! I know this\nprobably isn't the time for it, but I\nwant to splash around in a spring.
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_HOME2: We're supposed to be enjoying the\nsummer, but my brother is so moody.$k$pHe's always brooding! I wish he'd just\nlet himself have fun once in a while.
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_HOME3: You're not pushing yourself too hard,\nare you? I'd hate to see you get\nheatstroke.$k$pWhy don't we go relax in the shade?\nThat should cool you down.
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_HOME4: I really like this swimsuit. There's\nnothing formal about it. It's really\nliberating!
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_HOME5: I put my hair up so it doesn't get in\nthe way when I'm swimming. I'll help\nyou with your hair if you like.
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_FRIEND: How nice to meet you! I'm Tana, from\nFrelia. If you're looking for swim gear,\nask $Nf!
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_LEVEL1: It's thanks to my swimsuit. I'm\nsure of it!
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_LEVEL2: There we go!
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_LEVEL3: Oh, no! My strap got tangled...
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_SKILL: Thanks. It feels like the summer\nsun is shining down on me.
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_JOIN: Nice to meet you. I'm Tana! The\nocean is so inviting this summer—are\nyou ready to dive in?
MID_TURNER_SUMMER03_STRONGEST: Just look at that sunset. Gorgeous! A\nbeautiful end to another perfect day. It\nmakes me a bit sad...$k$pI'm having so much fun here with\neveryone that the sunsets are making\nme a little melancholy.$k$pRight now, I feel like I'm living in a\ndream...$k$pMy days are filled with joy and\nkindness, spent with my brother and\nmy friends.$k$pWe all fought so hard for this peace—\nInnes, Eirika, Ephraim, and so many\nothers. I treasure each moment.$k$pDon't tell Innes about this\nconversation. He'd laugh at my\nnaiveté... This is our little secret, OK?$k$pNow... What do you feel like doing\ntomorrow? The day is wide open!
