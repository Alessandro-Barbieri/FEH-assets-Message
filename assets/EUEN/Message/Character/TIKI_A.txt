MID_TIKI_A_HOME1: Sleepy... There's something about\nthis place I find relaxing. It reminds\nme of the Divine Dragon Grounds.
MID_TIKI_A_HOME2: Over my three millennia, I've said\nhello and farewell countless times.\nBut I will always remember you.
MID_TIKI_A_HOME3: Thank you for bringing me here—I can\nbe reunited with many familiar faces,\nincluding my precious Mar-Mar!
MID_TIKI_A_HOME4: We should take the time to chat.\nYou seem different from the people\nof this world and the "Heroes."
MID_TIKI_A_HOME5: I really do enjoy roaming this place.\nDon't you, $Nu?$k$pNo matter how old I get, new worlds\nare always exciting!
MID_TIKI_A_FRIEND: I bring greetings from your friend\n$Nf.$k$pValue your friendship—a good friend\nis a comfort forever.
MID_TIKI_A_LEVEL1: I vow to protect this world\nI share with the Heroes.
MID_TIKI_A_LEVEL2: I miss being in the heat of\nbattle like this!
MID_TIKI_A_LEVEL3: It must be my three millennia\ncatching up with me.

MID_TIKI_A_JOIN: I am Tiki. As a member of the Divine\nDragon Tribe, I can turn into a\ndragon! Some call me the Voice.
MID_TIKI_A_STRONGEST: Tell me...do you look forward to\nor dread the day you'll go\nhome from this world?$k$pPersonally, I can't stop thinking\nabout the sad day I will have to\npart with all my new friends.$k$pThe thought of saying good-bye to\nyou is especially sad. I suppose it's\na sign of how close we've grown.$k$pHeh. That's borrowing trouble from\nthe future, isn't it? Better to\nconcentrate on the happy present.$k$pThere is still plenty of time for us\nto spend together, and I plan to\nenjoy every moment of it.$k$pSomeday, when I look back on\nthese days, you will shine ever so\nbrightly in my memory...
