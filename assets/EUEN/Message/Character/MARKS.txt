MID_MARKS_HOME1: I feel as if I could learn much from\nPrince Alfonse and Princess\nSharena—the royalty of this kingdom.

MID_MARKS_HOME3: You always look very busy. That\nreminds me of a time when...$k$pWell, when one of my siblings began\nleading an army. So, mind your\nlimits. Stay safe and healthy.
MID_MARKS_HOME4: I'd like it if you would train with me\nfrom time to time. We don't need to\nspar—just do practice swings.$k$pYou'd be surprised how simply\nthat communicates as well as\nwords could ever manage.

I'm not\ntrying to forge you into a fighter.$k$pI believe that meeting a friend\nblade to blade is the truest way to\ngive voice to our inner qualities.$k$pIn swordplay, you can share your\nhopes and fears as our leader and I\ncan parry with things unsaid.$k$pI wouldn't spar like this with just\nanyone. You've proven yourself\nworthy on the battlefield!$k$pNow, what say you? Would you\nstill rather not...?$k$pOh, you'll join me! Well then, know\nthat it is my honor completely,\n$Nu.
