MID_JEIGUN_HOME1: This is a fine castle, full of history\nand style. Perhaps not as grand as\nAltea Castle, but that's a high bar...
MID_JEIGUN_HOME2: King Cornelius, you should know\nthat Prince Marth has matured\ninto a fine man...
MID_JEIGUN_HOME3: Exemplary patrolling! Next time,\nI shall accompany you—don't\nthink I can't keep up!
MID_JEIGUN_HOME4: I could regale you with the history\nof Altea and Prince Marth's deeds...\nbut we would be here for days.
MID_JEIGUN_HOME5: It seems I've injured my back.\nWould you be so kind as to press\nhard just there?
MID_JEIGUN_FRIEND: You are $Nu?$k$pI bring kindest greetings\nfrom $Nf.
MID_JEIGUN_LEVEL1: Hmph. It would appear I'm still\ngood for something.
MID_JEIGUN_LEVEL2: Only natural for a paladin of Altea.
MID_JEIGUN_LEVEL3: I have dishonored my rank and\nmy country.
MID_JEIGUN_SKILL: To think I still had new tricks to\nlearn...
MID_JEIGUN_JOIN: I am Jagen of the knights of Altea,\nPrince Marth's guardian. I will thank\nyou not to treat me like an old man.
MID_JEIGUN_STRONGEST: I have served many years as a\nknight, but never have I met\nsomeone quite like you.$k$pDo we all follow you because you\nsummoned us? I think not. At\nleast not solely.$k$pThere is something about you that\ninspires others to fight for you.\nI can't put it into words...$k$pIt reminds me a bit of Prince Marth,\nwho also naturally draws heroes\nto his cause.$k$pIn any case, I sincerely wish to\nspend what days I have left\nfighting at your side.
