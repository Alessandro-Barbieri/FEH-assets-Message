MID_WENDY_HOME1: This castle has been built with\nexcellent defense in mind. It will\nrebuff foes more easily. Admirable.
MID_WENDY_HOME2: Where I'm from, women are rarely the\nkind of knights who wear heavy armor.\nBut I want to be like my dear brother.
MID_WENDY_HOME3: I admire how seriously you take these\npatrols of yours. I'd accompany you,\nbut I fear that I'd slow you down.
MID_WENDY_HOME4: Between you and me, this armor is\nsimply murder on my back!
MID_WENDY_HOME5: Wearing heavy armor like this takes\ndaily practice. It's harder than you\nthink, just walking around.
MID_WENDY_FRIEND: I've come a long way to bid you\nhello, $Nu.$k$pOh, not from me personally. I bring\ngreetings from your good friend\n$Nf.
MID_WENDY_LEVEL1: Such power! Now you can\nreally rely on me!
MID_WENDY_LEVEL2: As expected for a knight of\nOstia.
MID_WENDY_LEVEL3: I mustn't be a burden on\nothers...
MID_WENDY_SKILL: I never imagined I could get this\nstrong!
MID_WENDY_JOIN: I'm Gwendolyn, one of the knights of\nOstia. Some say I wear this armor as a\nsort of spectacle. They're quite wrong.
MID_WENDY_STRONGEST: I've got to say that I appreciate\nall of your guidance in battle.$k$pBut sometimes I worry that you\ntry to protect me too much out there.$k$pAm I failing to do my part as a knight,\nprotecting others, if you're always\nworried about my safety?$k$pMaybe you think that I draw too\nmuch attention to myself by wearing\nsuch colorful armor.$k$pBut that's exactly why I do wear\nthis—to draw foes to me and\naway from others!$k$pI know that we need to act as a\nteam out there, but my role really is\nto put myself in harm's way!$k$pStill, thank you. I'll always have the\ncourage to protect everyone, knowing\nthat you're looking out for me.
MID_WENDY_VOICE01: えいっ！
MID_WENDY_VOICE02: はぁっ！
MID_WENDY_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_WENDY_VOICE04: I can't...be a burden...

MID_WENDY_VOICE07: With all my might!
MID_WENDY_VOICE08: And now, my turn!
MID_WENDY_VOICE09: Sorry...
MID_WENDY_VOICE10: Heehee
MID_WENDY_VOICE11: Oh MY! Whew...what a surprise. Next time, maybe just say hi.
MID_WENDY_VOICE12: Please don't let me fall over in this armor. It'd be impossible to get up again.
MID_WENDY_VOICE13: A truly loyal knight is ever glad to bear the heaviest of armor.
MID_WENDY_VOICE14: This armor adds a tremendous amount of bulk! Really, you wouldn't believe it.
MID_WENDY_VOICE15: I offer my gratitude for your kindness and your consideration.
MID_WENDY_VOICE16: One, TWO! And one, TWO! Whew!

MID_WENDY_VOICE19: Certainly.
MID_WENDY_VOICE20: My turn?
