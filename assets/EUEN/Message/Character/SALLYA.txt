MID_SALLYA_HOME1: Sharena and Anna both asked me for\nmy "beauty secrets." My secrets\nhave NOTHING to do with beauty...
MID_SALLYA_HOME2: I served Plegia until I chose to cast\nmy lot with Ylisse. But you know...$k$pI was truly braided by fate with\nonly one person in my past.
MID_SALLYA_HOME3: Tired from all that walking around?\nI could curse you so you can't\nsleep, if you like.
MID_SALLYA_HOME4: Ah, er, goodness me! This weather is\nbenign, eh? ...Did that sound normal?\nWhich version of me do you like?
MID_SALLYA_HOME5: I like working on new hexes. So if\nyou talk to me at the wrong time,\nyou might suffer...consequences.
MID_SALLYA_FRIEND: I would have words with you. Now,\nyou must be the one called\n$Nu, yes?$k$pSomeone close to me has taken\nan interest in you... Someone named\n$Nf.
MID_SALLYA_LEVEL1: I can feel the darkness\ngrowing ever stronger...
MID_SALLYA_LEVEL2: Hee hee hee...
MID_SALLYA_LEVEL3: Who DARED to curse me?!
MID_SALLYA_SKILL: Enhancing MY power? You don't\nknow what's good for you...
MID_SALLYA_JOIN: You may call me Tharja. I am a dark\nmage from Plegia. Now, I shall be\nyour shadow...
MID_SALLYA_STRONGEST: Ah, excellent—it seems my hex\nto summon you worked\nimmediately.$k$pYes, that's right. You came here\nbecause of a hex—a hex that made\nyou want to talk to me.$k$pI sprinkled powdered lizard on this\npaper, and you were drawn toward it.\n...Hm? The lizard's worn off...$k$pSo you came here of your own free\nwill? Surprising, yet...not.$k$pHeehee... I already have someone\nI'm destined to be with, but you're\njust as precious to me.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE01: えい…
MID_SALLYA_VOICE02: そぉら…
MID_SALLYA_VOICE03: ...Ow.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE04: What's the big idea...
MID_SALLYA_VOICE05: You're already dead.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE06: Do you like darkness?
MID_SALLYA_VOICE07: Hahahaha!
MID_SALLYA_VOICE08: You won't get away from me.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE09: Curses...
MID_SALLYA_VOICE10: Heehee...
MID_SALLYA_VOICE11: Did you need something?
MID_SALLYA_VOICE12: I've taken a real interest in you.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE13: Last night you turned over 13 times in your sleep. Impressive.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE14: I like you, but my true devotion is for a particular tactician...
MID_SALLYA_VOICE15: I'll curse all of them. No one will survive.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE16: I just finished it—an extra-special hex just for you.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE17: Heehee... Too late to regret summoning me now.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE18: Yes...
MID_SALLYA_VOICE19: Oh. Joy.
MID_SALLYA_VOICE20: What now?
