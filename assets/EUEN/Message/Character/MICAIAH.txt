MID_MICAIAH_HOME1: I saw a lovely sunset the other day.$k$pEven though I've been summoned to\na different world, nature continues to\nastound me with its beauty.
MID_MICAIAH_HOME2: People continue to fight and kill each\nother, no matter the world, or the era.\nYet, still... I find myself...
MID_MICAIAH_HOME3: I don't really like crowds. Sometimes,\nI sneak off to the forest to catch a\nbreak.$k$pI'm guessing the guiding hand of this\narmy might need a break, too!
MID_MICAIAH_HOME4: I found some delicious-looking fruit\nwhile I was strolling around the\ncastle grounds. Want some?
MID_MICAIAH_HOME5: I was thinking... While I'm here, I can\nbe my true self. Here, my past has no\nhold on me.$k$pAnd when I think that... I can't help but\nwish that I could stay here forever.

MID_MICAIAH_STRONGEST: You know, you're kind and thoughtful,\n$Nu.$k$pMy brother and I live apart, now...but\nthe way you worry about me reminds\nme of him.$k$pIt's strange to feel this way, yet it's\nalso intensely familiar...$k$pThe skies that separate me from my\nbrother are vast. But I'm starting to\nthink of you as family, too.$k$pStill, there's something I haven't been\nable to tell you yet—something about\nmyself.$k$pEven now, I can't reveal everything\nabout myself or my powers. $k$pSomeday, though...

MID_MICAIAH_VOICE12: Eek! W-wait, Yune! Hold still!
MID_MICAIAH_VOICE13: I can tell what people are thinking, you know. Right now you were thinking about how jealous you are!
MID_MICAIAH_VOICE14: Sometimes I get very frightened. I can't think what I'd do if I lost you. It feels like my heart would rip apart.
MID_MICAIAH_VOICE15: I believe in you. You have a pure heart.
MID_MICAIAH_VOICE16: The visions I see spreading out before us... We're meeting others and forming bonds... And we're fighting side by side.
