MID_SIGLUD_HOME1: I love Deirdre—so much so that even\nwere my love for her a crime, I would\ncontinue to love her without regret.
MID_SIGLUD_HOME2: Eldigan, my dear friend... Why were\nyou fated to die?
MID_SIGLUD_HOME3: I know there's a lot of work to do, and\nmany rely on you.$k$pSurely, though, you can find others\nwilling to take on some of these tasks.\nI, for one, would be happy to help.
MID_SIGLUD_HOME4: My son, Seliph, is safe. Nothing else\ncould make me happier.
MID_SIGLUD_HOME5: When the fighting is done, I will rejoin\nmy son, Seliph. This is the promise I\nmade him.
MID_SIGLUD_FRIEND: Are you $Nu?$k$pGood. I bring a letter for you, from\n$Nf.
MID_SIGLUD_LEVEL1: As a descendant of Baldr, I will\nnot betray your confidence in me.
MID_SIGLUD_LEVEL2: I must get stronger. My country\nand its people need me.
MID_SIGLUD_LEVEL3: What a poor example I set.
MID_SIGLUD_SKILL: You honor me more than I\ndeserve. I will repay you.
MID_SIGLUD_JOIN: I am Sigurd. I am the heir to the\nduchy of Chalphy and descend from\nthe crusader Baldr.
MID_SIGLUD_STRONGEST: When others schemed against us, my\nfather and I were branded as traitors.\nOur family's honor was lost.$k$pI fought to bring the truth to light and\nhonor back to our name. But I failed.$k$pSeliph fought so hard to dispel the\nregrets I left behind, even at his\nyoung age...$k$pThe Scion of Light, eradicating the\ndarkness, and avenging his father—\nthat's how people must see him.$k$pOf course, there's more than one way\nto look at things. Evil can be seen as\ngood—and good, evil.$k$pThis is, unfortunately, something I\nlearned too late.$k$pI must explain this to Seliph. It is my\nduty as his father—I must do what I\ncan to help him become a true king.
