MID_EPHRAIM_HOME1: I might not look it, but I really\ndo hope for peace.$k$pI've always got my lance handy,\nbut there's nothing more precious\nto me than a kingdom at ease.
MID_EPHRAIM_HOME2: I always worry about my sister,\nEirika. If I'm not there to protect\nher, anything could happen.
MID_EPHRAIM_HOME3: You're always looking after us.\nThat sort of kindness reminds me of\nmy sister. Must be why I like you.
MID_EPHRAIM_HOME4: You say weapons are shaped like\nyour Breidablik back in your world?\nI'd like to visit and see that for myself.
MID_EPHRAIM_HOME5: The royalty of other worlds seem to\nprefer the sword. I like the lance.\nLances have the edge over swords.$k$pYou know, I once had ambitions to\nbe the greatest spearman on Magvel,\nthe continent I call home.
MID_EPHRAIM_FRIEND: I'm Ephraim. Now, how about we cut\nthis short and get to sparring? It's a\nbetter way to get to know each other.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEVEL1: My power grows. But I mustn't\nlet it go to my head.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEVEL2: I must get more powerful.\nAnd I will.
MID_EPHRAIM_LEVEL3: How can I ever protect my\nsister at this rate?
MID_EPHRAIM_SKILL: I will be the master of my power.\nNot the reverse.
MID_EPHRAIM_JOIN: I am Ephraim of Renais, a prince\nand skilled spearman. So, point me\nat my enemy. I'll get to work.
MID_EPHRAIM_STRONGEST: It seems that I've gotten much\nstronger here. My power has grown\nalmost to overflowing.$k$pThat isn't enough. Oh, I don't mean\nmy strength. I've always been\ncapable enough there.$k$pI mean that strength isn't always\nenough to protect us. Yes, it\nhelps force a foe to submit.$k$pBut strength can also blind one\nto others' feelings. That is exactly\nhow I once lost a good friend.$k$pI must become kinder and more\ncompassionate, or else I risk\nrepeating my mistakes.$k$pYou have those qualities. And\nso I must remain with you.\nThen I will learn all I need to.$k$pYou'll find that I'm a grateful\nstudent...and friend.

MID_EPHRAIM_VOICE11: You can rely on me for anything you require.
MID_EPHRAIM_VOICE12: Oh! Don't startle me. You almost met with the tip of my lance.
MID_EPHRAIM_VOICE13: Trust me. I don't pick fights I can't win.
MID_EPHRAIM_VOICE14: You know, I like you. And I feel I can trust you completely.
MID_EPHRAIM_VOICE15: Here's some advice. Let the fools spread gossip. The rest of us have work to do.
MID_EPHRAIM_VOICE16: I must protect Eirika, as a brother ought to do for his sister.
