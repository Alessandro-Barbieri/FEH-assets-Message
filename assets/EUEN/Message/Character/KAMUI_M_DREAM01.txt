MID_KAMUI_M_DREAM01_STRONGEST: Some people find pleasure in\nattacking those who can't fight back.\nSad to say, but it's true.$k$pAzura's heart has been wounded by\npeople like that. And as long as she\nseeks revenge, it will never heal.$k$pThat is why I want to stay at her side.\nIf I protect her and give those\nwounds time to heal...$k$pthen perhaps she can grow stronger\nand find a way to live on her own\nsomeday.$k$pI know she has the strength to walk\non her own two feet. She just has to\nfind it.$k$pUntil then, I will watch over her.\nAlways.
