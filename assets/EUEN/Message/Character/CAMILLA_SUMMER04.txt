MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_HOME1: Whew... The sun's out in full force\ntoday. If I'm not careful, I'll wind up\nburnt from head to toe.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_HOME2: Ahh... The sunlight is simply brilliant.\nIt feels so good shining down on me.$k$pI wish every citizen of Nohr could\nshare in this experience...
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_HOME3: Oh no, your cheeks are all red! Did\nyou get a sunburn? Don't worry, I'll\nstay by your side until you're all better.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_HOME4: What a lovely spot. Would you mind if\nI took a short nap? I'd need you to\nstay close by, of course...$k$pJust for my own peace of mind.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_HOME5: I wasn't sure I'd be able to handle\nbeing away from my sweet younger\nsibling for so long, but...$k$pWell, relaxing here just a little bit\nlonger should be fine... Right?
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_FRIEND: Have we had the pleasure of\nmeeting? I'm Camilla, princess of\nNohr.$k$pI'm currently enjoying a little vacation\nwith $Nf.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_LEVEL1: I have to work much harder with\nyou watching my every move.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_LEVEL2: I'd say this qualifies as\nremarkable.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_LEVEL3: Maybe a cool drink will help me\nfocus...
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_SKILL: You keep growing my repertoire,\nand I'll keep doing my best.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_JOIN: I'm Camilla, eldest princess of the\nkingdom of Nohr. I'm not a big fan of\nthe heat, so maybe...$k$pTry to find some oceanfront\nbattlefields so we can cool off\nafter each fight?
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_STRONGEST: The enemy wasted so much time\nsizing me up before that last battle.\nThe poor fools...$k$pMight as well have signed their own\ndeath warrants, the way they just\ngawked as I tore through their ranks.$k$pYou, however... You've had me all\nfigured out since day one, haven't\nyou?$k$pYou know I'm at my best when sent to\nthe front lines to obliterate your foes.$k$pOh, don't look so worried. I may be a\nprincess, but I'm not so delicate. I'll\nnever shy away from my inner warrior.$k$pHeehee, you're sweet for wanting to\nshield me. Come, now... Give me a\nhug. Allow me to shield you instead.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE01: はっ
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE02: いくわよ
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE03: やるわね
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE04: あら、悪い子…
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE05: Shall we drown them?
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE06: Tropical attack!
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE07: I'll bury you in the sand.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE08: Don't get too excited!
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE09: Summer's end... How tragic.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE10: Oh my...
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE11: Whenever I ask anyone to help me apply sunscreen, they just blush madly and run away...
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE12: Be honest, now: How does this swimsuit look? Why are you blushing?
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE13: When the sun is beating down on you, nothing hits the spot quite like a cold drink.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE14: Ooh! I feel so light! Maybe I should always fight like this.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE15: There's no ocean to jump into, so you can jump straight into my arms instead!
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE16: I can't forget to pick out some souvenirs for my darling retainers.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE17: The tropical sea is simply stunning. One day I'll take you and Corrin both to see it.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE18: Very well.
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE19: Time for a swim?
MID_CAMILLA_SUMMER04_VOICE20: Gotta cool off.
