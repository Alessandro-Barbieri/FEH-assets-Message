MID_VIAUR_HOME1: Ah, cruel boredom, why must you\nhound me so? Perhaps I shall go\nand admire a mirror for a while...
MID_VIAUR_HOME2: I am the rightful ruler of Rosanne,\na duchy in faraway Valm. I was...\nforced from my homeland.
MID_VIAUR_HOME3: I have noted your good works in\npatrolling and leading us. You've\ndone well to draw my eye!
MID_VIAUR_HOME4: Might I interest you in a game of\nchess? I promise to avoid dirty\ntricks till the latter half of the game.
MID_VIAUR_HOME5: I've brewed some tea using some of\nthe fascinating herbs you grow in\nthis land... Hmm? Weeds, you say?
MID_VIAUR_FRIEND: I come bearing gracious greetings\nfor $Nu.$k$pAh, from whom? Well, none other\nthan $Nf!
MID_VIAUR_LEVEL1: Please! Avert your envious gazes!
MID_VIAUR_LEVEL2: I could do no less—not with my\nreputation!
MID_VIAUR_LEVEL3: What? So little gain for my efforts?
MID_VIAUR_SKILL: I see you have granted me\npower to match my splendor!
MID_VIAUR_JOIN: I am Virion, the finest archer\nof the fairest of realms.\nDelighted to be of service.
MID_VIAUR_STRONGEST: Ah, may I steal a bit of your time,\n$Nu?$k$pI've grown fascinated with the\nboard games of other cultures\nlately. Care to play one now?$k$pTake a look—this board is the\nbattlefield and this dazzling little\ngemstone is yours truly.$k$pAll of these pieces—you move\nthem around the board as you\nwould fighters in a battle.$k$pYes, yes... Of course... Very good.\nYou grasp the game quickly, as\nI suspected you would.$k$pBut I see that you're not willing\nto sacrifice that dazzling little\ngemstone...$k$pWho can blame you? It is more\nscintillating than all the rest!\nStill, I need to tell you...$k$pYou're playing that wrong. It's\nbetter strategy to sacrifice any\npiece for the greater good.$k$pMuch as you could choose to\nrid yourself of me from your\nteam to serve your purposes.$k$pThere are other Heroes to bring\ninto the fold. But do I sense...that\nyou're repelled by the idea?$k$pYou don't want to sacrifice anyone,\ndo you? Very well. Then as the\nfirst Hero you summoned...$k$pI will make it my duty to keep\npolishing myself into the most\ndazzling stone in your possession!
