MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_HOME1: Sharena's personality suits this sort\nof getup... My sister has a modern\nsensibility. But me? Why ME?
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_HOME2: Are you aware of a race in the World\nof Awakening called taguel? They can\nchange to a form similar to a rabbit.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_HOME3: It seems my sister prepared a\ncostume for you as well.$k$pShe suggested that we might be less\nembarrassed if you dressed up, too...\nSo where is it?
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_HOME4: Do you have a spare moment? I'd like\nto train if you're up for it.$k$pNo, we will not be practicing our\nbunny hops.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_HOME5: My father is stern and very serious...\nI think seeing me in this getup would\nprobably make him faint.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_FRIEND: I bring regards from\n$Nf.$k$pEr... Now, if you'll excuse me...
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_LEVEL1: It truly is the springtime of my\nyouth, wouldn't you say?
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_LEVEL2: Plant the seeds, and springtime\nwill be in full blossom.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_LEVEL3: There's still a chill in the air...
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_SKILL: Thank you. You are as bright\nas the springtime sun.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_JOIN: I am Alfonse, Prince of Askr. Please...\nLet's talk about something besides\nthis costume. What do you say?
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_STRONGEST: So, $Nu...$k$pI've been studying the spring festival.\nThe symbolism of the celebration is\nfascinating...$k$pEggs represent life and birth...while\nrabbits bear a large number of\noffspring, so—$k$pOh, the costume? I guess I'm stuck\nwith it until Sharena says it's OK to\npack it up.$k$pIt's funny...maybe even scary...how\nfast you can get used to something.$k$pThe longer I'm dressed like this, the\nstranger the idea of taking it off\nseems! The idea puts me on edge...$k$pBut I can rest assured you'll stay\nfriends with me no matter how I'm\nattired, I suppose. No need to worry!$k$pThanks, $Nu.\nIt's nice to know I can count on you.

MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_VOICE13: Festivals have been important to people since ancient times.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_VOICE14: It never occurred to me that I'd be the one dressing like this.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_VOICE15: You think this outfit looks good on me? I'm not sure how I feel about that.
MID_ALFONS_SPRING02_VOICE16: At times like these, I'm envious of Sharena's carefree attitude.
