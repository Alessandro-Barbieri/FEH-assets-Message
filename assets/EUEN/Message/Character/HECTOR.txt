MID_HECTOR_HOME1: Fine castle you have here. It's not\nreally my thing to stay cooped up all\nday though. Let's get to battling!
MID_HECTOR_HOME2: The name of my axe is Armads.\nIt was once wielded by a legendary\nberserker, you know.$k$pOnce had a chance to meet the\nman, believe it or not. He's one\ndangerous-looking fellow.
MID_HECTOR_HOME3: One of my best friends goes by the\nname of Eliwood. We spar for fun.\nHe even wins half the time!
MID_HECTOR_HOME4: I'm really bored. How about we\nspar for a while? Don't worry.\nI'll go easy on you, friend!
MID_HECTOR_HOME5: Someone once told me that knights\nshould stand their ground, but that's\nreally just not my style.
MID_HECTOR_FRIEND: I'm Hector. You must be\n$Nu.$k$pI've come to say hello—sent over by\n$Nf, in fact!
MID_HECTOR_LEVEL1: Whoa! Now that's how to do it!
MID_HECTOR_LEVEL2: Good enough. Now if I can only\nkeep this up.
MID_HECTOR_LEVEL3: Bah! I'll lose to Eliwood if I can't\ndo better.
MID_HECTOR_SKILL: Now I'll show you what Hector\nof Ostia is all about!
MID_HECTOR_JOIN: I'm Hector, from a realm called Ostia.\nBut I'm not its ruler. My brother,\nUther, is marquess at the moment.
MID_HECTOR_STRONGEST: I'm no poet, friend, so bear with\nme here. I have a hard time\nputting my thoughts into words.$k$pBut before I joined you, I thought\nthat as long as I just kept on\nswinging in battle...$k$pI'd always come out on top and\nbring everyone back from battle,\nsafe and sound.$k$pThen I noticed how you, as\ntactician, see the line between\nlife and death like no one else.$k$pNot sure why, but that hit me hard.\nAnyway, know that I've got your\nback—long as you've got mine.
MID_HECTOR_VOICE01: おらっ！
MID_HECTOR_VOICE02: おらぁっ！
MID_HECTOR_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_HECTOR_VOICE04: Better than I thought!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE05: I don't back down!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE06: Gutsy, aren't you?
MID_HECTOR_VOICE07: Enough chitchat!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE08: Here we go!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE09: Not here!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE10: Heh
MID_HECTOR_VOICE11: You need me for something, friend?
MID_HECTOR_VOICE12: Oho! Feels like you're ready to head out. Me too!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE13: Push your limits—that's what I say. But don't burn yourself out.
MID_HECTOR_VOICE14: How about we spar a bit? What say you?
MID_HECTOR_VOICE15: I know we're all in it together. Just letting you know: I'm ALL in.
MID_HECTOR_VOICE16: So...I'm going to die on the battlefield...
MID_HECTOR_VOICE17: I'd better keep an eye on you. Trouble abounds in battle.
MID_HECTOR_VOICE18: Oho!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE19: All right!
MID_HECTOR_VOICE20: On it!
