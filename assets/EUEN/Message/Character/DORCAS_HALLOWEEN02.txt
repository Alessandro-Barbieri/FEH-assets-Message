MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_HOME1: Everywhere I go lately, people call\nout to me. Do I really stand out that\nmuch in this getup?
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_HOME2: The harvest festival, huh? If Natalie\nwere here, I'm sure she'd be off\nsketching something...
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_HOME3: Don't worry... My face isn't made for\nsmiling, but this is my happy face.\nTake my word for it.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_HOME4: Here, take some of this candy off my\nhands. It looks questionable, but...it's\nsafe. Tested it myself.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_HOME5: Every time I approach someone, they\nturn as white as a sheet and just\nsurrender their candy to me.$k$pBut I'm the one trying to get rid of\ncandy here.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_FRIEND: Sorry if I scared you. Just wanted to\nsay hi from $Nf.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_LEVEL1: Not too shabby... This outfit isn't all\nbad, now that I'm used to it.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_LEVEL2: Still not entirely sure what a "good\ntrick" is supposed to be...
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_LEVEL3: Guess I'm just not cut out for this\nfestival business.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_SKILL: Hey, thanks for that. Uh... Take some\ncandy in return if you want.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_JOIN: I'm Dorcas. I'm not usually one for\nfestivals, but...figured if I'm going, I\nmight as well go as a monster.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_STRONGEST: To be honest, this outfit had me, uh...\na little bit...perplexed at first.$k$pI've never been any good at showing\nmy emotions. So I've never been sure\nif a guy like me could be any fun.$k$pBut thanks to these children's smiling\nfaces...all that uneasiness just melts\naway.$k$pThis getup actually makes people\nsmile. Kids call out to me, and they\nlaugh... That's a first.$k$pThis harvest festival is a good thing...\nI see that now.$k$pNext time I'm with Natalie, maybe I'll\nlet her see me in this costume. It may\nbring a smile to her face, too.

MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE10: Well?
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE11: Just can't get used to this getup.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE12: Don't try to spook me. I'm scaring you.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE13: Making it from day to day takes everything I got. Never had much time for festivals.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE14: This candy might make my wife happy.
MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE15: You think I look good in this getup? I'm just not seeing it.

MID_DORCAS_HALLOWEEN02_VOICE19: More candy?
