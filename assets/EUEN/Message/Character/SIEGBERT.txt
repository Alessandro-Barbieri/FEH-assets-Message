MID_SIEGBERT_HOME1: Prince Alfonse is amazing. I could\nlearn a lot from him. His mannerisms\nand battle etiquette are so polished.
MID_SIEGBERT_HOME2: I was raised in the Deeprealms, so\nthere is much about the world I still\ndo not know.$k$pThat's not to say my education was\nlacking. But if in your eyes I leave\nsomething to be desired, do tell me.
MID_SIEGBERT_HOME3: Please leave the patrols to me. You\nneedn't hesitate to assign me tasks\njust because I'm a prince.$k$pWe are all of the same standing here.\nEveryone is a fellow soldier.
MID_SIEGBERT_HOME4: Would you allow me to watch your\nsummoning ceremony up close? I\nhave never seen such a skill before.$k$pIt's quite amazing. If I had a power like\nthat, then I...
MID_SIEGBERT_HOME5: I was just reading a book in the\nOrder's library, when I—$k$pWhat? I'm not allowed in the library?!\nM-my apologies! How could I have\nmade such a mistake?!
MID_SIEGBERT_FRIEND: I come with a fond greeting from\n$Nf. This\ncastle looks entertaining...$k$pWould you mind if I visited again?
MID_SIEGBERT_LEVEL1: I've grown so much so suddenly!
MID_SIEGBERT_LEVEL2: I'm an even greater help to the\nteam.
MID_SIEGBERT_LEVEL3: I'm still too young, it seems...
MID_SIEGBERT_SKILL: Many thanks for this! I'll make\ngood use of it.
MID_SIEGBERT_JOIN: It's good to meet you. I'm Siegbert.\nPrince Xander of Nohr is my father,\nso as a future king, I'll give it my all.
MID_SIEGBERT_STRONGEST: Well met, $Nu.\nChecking in while on patrol, are you?\nThere's nothing to report here.$k$pHuh? You're not on patrol, but you're\nhere to chat? Well, I must admit... I do\nlook forward to talking with you.$k$pBack home, most are too aware that\nI'm the future king of Nohr to engage\nme with anything but pleasantries.$k$pBut I'm glad people are more open to\napproaching me here.$k$pIt's not that I dislike my home—that's\nnot it at all. However, here I can be\nhonest and I can truly express myself.$k$pYou've become important to me, in a\nway that exceeds friendship. I raise\nmy sword for you, my compatriot.
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE02: せいっ！
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE03: うあっ！
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE04: 耐えてみせる…！
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE05: Be ready!
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE06: No holding back!
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE07: Kneel before me!
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE08: I will end this!
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE09: I'm sorry...Father...
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE10: Heehee
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE11: Everything in this kingdom is so...beautiful. So much abundance!
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE12: I cannot shirk my studies if I wish to become a great king.
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE13: I'm awfully curious about the Order of Heroes... Tell me, are the regulations very strict?
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE14: I'd like to talk with as many people from this world as I can.
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE15: I must admit, I'm a little jealous of that divine weapon you carry...
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE16: When will the day come that I finally swing Siegfried with my own hand?
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE17: The burden of living up to my father has weighed on my mind for some time. I wish to be as great a prince as he, so you will have my support until this war is over.
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE18: Yes.
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE19: I'm Siegbert.
MID_SIEGBERT_VOICE20: Let's do this together.
