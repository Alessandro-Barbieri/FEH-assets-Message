MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_HOME1: This gown is simply stifling... But I\nsuppose we all suffer for those we\nlove, from time to time.
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_HOME2: Love is a hex that binds two souls for\nas long as they both shall live.$k$pWhether I'm the hexed or the one\ndoing the hexing... I'm ready.
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_HOME3: Ahh, I feel so relaxed right now...\nMaybe I'll cast a little curse on you.
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_HOME4: A little bit of this... And a little of that...\nHmhmhm... This love potion will...\nHuh? Oh, it's you.$k$pTrust me when I say you're better off\nforgetting what you saw just now.
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_HOME5: Normally I spend my time researching\nnew curses, but for some reason this\noutfit has my thoughts...elsewhere...
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_FRIEND: Here's a message from\n$Nf. Don't\nworry—I didn't hide a curse inside.
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_LEVEL1: I feel like the whole world is\ncelebrating with me. Heehee...
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_LEVEL2: Must be the power of love.\nHmhmhm...
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_LEVEL3: Someone is standing in the way\nof my happiness...
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_SKILL: Is this a symbol of your love?\nWhy, thank you...
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_JOIN: I'm Tharja—just a typical spring bride!\nSo, point me in the direction of my\nfated one, and I'll handle the rest.
MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_STRONGEST: I'm glad you're here,\n$Nu. I...need\nyour advice on something...$k$pI know who I'm fated to be with, of\ncourse. After all, I'm dressed up just\nfor him.$k$pBut then I came here and met you...\nAnd, well, somehow you've become\njust as important to me.$k$pSo how am I supposed to choose\nbetween the two of you? Ugh, this is\nall your fault.$k$pSo, now what should I do? I used to\nthink love was a hex of happiness.$k$pBut now I see it's a curse as dark and\nmalicious as any other.

MID_SALLYA_BRIDE02_VOICE12: Hmph. Seeing me like this may be shocking, but don't get used to it. It's not for you.
