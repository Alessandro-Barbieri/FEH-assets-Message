MID_LLOYD_HOME1: There's something about this\nplace that gets under my\nskin. It's decent enough.$k$pMaybe that's the problem.\nIt's not at all like places where\nthe Black Fang met.
MID_LLOYD_HOME2: We of the real Black Fang never\nkilled for pleasure.$k$pWe exterminated lowlifes—those\nwho preyed upon those who\ncouldn't fight for themselves.
MID_LLOYD_HOME3: Your weapon is something else...\nI wonder if you could use it to\nshoot vermin somehow.
MID_LLOYD_HOME4: My younger brother and I both\ndelivered the Fang's justice to\nevil vermin who deserved it.$k$pBut Linus can be reckless,\nespecially when I'm not there\nto rein the guy in.
MID_LLOYD_HOME5: The Black Fang has its Four\nFangs, those who really get their\nhands the dirtiest. Who are they?$k$pSure, I'll tell you. Two of 'em are\nthe Angel of Death and the\nBlue Crow...Jaffar and Ursula.$k$pAnd of course, there's me and my\nbrother, Linus... We're the White\nWolf and the Mad Dog.
MID_LLOYD_FRIEND: So, I take it that you're\n$Nu?$k$pHey, relax. I bring greetings, not...\njustice.
MID_LLOYD_LEVEL1: Heh, nice. Almost too good to\nbelieve.
MID_LLOYD_LEVEL2: Just about what I expected.
MID_LLOYD_LEVEL3: Eh. Guess I'm not a young\nbuck anymore.
MID_LLOYD_SKILL: Thanks. Every bit helps when\nhunting vermin.
MID_LLOYD_JOIN: I'm Lloyd—the White Wolf of\nBlack Fang. Know some vermin?\nI'll exterminate 'em for you.
MID_LLOYD_STRONGEST: Got some truth for you. You know\nthe Black Fang that I'm always\ntalking about?$k$pWell, I'm more proud of what we\nwere...than what we are.$k$pOh, we've always been covered\nin blood, but it was always for a\ndecent cause—uh, back then.$k$pWhen? Well, before a bunch of\nstuff happened. But the Fang\nfell into some shadowy business.$k$pStill, being here brings back\ngood memories of dark deeds\ndone for the right reasons.$k$pYou remind me of my brother too.\nSo I'd better stick around to keep\nyou out of his kind of trouble.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE01: はぁっ！
MID_LLOYD_VOICE02: はっ！
MID_LLOYD_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_LLOYD_VOICE04: …っな…
MID_LLOYD_VOICE05: Fang's justice!
MID_LLOYD_VOICE06: You won't escape.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE07: Don't blame me for your fate.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE08: It's time for you to die.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE09: Beaten...
MID_LLOYD_VOICE10: Heh
MID_LLOYD_VOICE11: Need someone eliminated? I'll consider it.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE12: This poking and prodding... What are we, children?
MID_LLOYD_VOICE13: We Fangs eliminate lowlifes—no matter how high their station.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE14: In the Fangs, I am known as the White Wolf.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE15: How fortunate that neither of us is a lowlife...or the Fangs would strike.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE16: The law of the Fangs is absolute. There's no wiggle room.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE17: I like your face. Seems like you're the type who values your true family. We see eye to eye on this.
MID_LLOYD_VOICE18: Mm-hmm?
MID_LLOYD_VOICE19: Yes?
MID_LLOYD_VOICE20: All right.
