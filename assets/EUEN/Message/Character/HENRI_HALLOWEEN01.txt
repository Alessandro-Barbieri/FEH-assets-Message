MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_HOME1: Shouldn't the Order of Heroes get into\nthe spirit of things? I could scare up a\ncostume for you...$k$pI have some animal pelts and bones\nlying around. Those might work for...\nsomething!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_HOME2: Ylisse's harvest festival was fun, but\nthe one I went to in the Outrealms—\nwow!$k$pI taught Ricken and Frederick all\nabout dark magic.
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_HOME3: Nice work out there. You don't have\nto be such a goody-goody, though.$k$pYou should play some tricks on\npeople sometimes... Have a little\nfun! Nya ha ha!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_HOME4: It's a harvest festival, right? So we\nshould go harvest some candy!$k$pOr maybe you'd rather harvest the\nheads of our enemies... I'm up for\neither one!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_HOME5: I'm working on a hex that will kill all\nof our enemies. I just need the fresh\nblood of one hundred people...
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_FRIEND: Give me some candy, or I'll cast a hex\non you! Just kidding. Nya ha ha!\nI'm only here to deliver a greeting.
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_LEVEL1: Let's see somebody try to play a\ntrick on me now! Nya ha ha!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_LEVEL2: Ghoulish strength flows through\nme! Yay!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_LEVEL3: Nya ha ha! Guess I need to drink\nsome more blood!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_SKILL: Ooh... You've made me stronger.\nI'll hex lots of enemies now!
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_JOIN: I'm Henry! I want candy...but blood is\ngood, too! Send your enemies my\nway, so I can play my tricks on them.
MID_HENRI_HALLOWEEN01_STRONGEST: Something just popped into my\nhead. I was wondering what kind of\nharvest makes you the happiest!$k$pDo you love to mow down your\nenemies? Or would you rather\nharvest hard-to-get Heroes?$k$pOf course, I love to kill my enemies.\nBut being harvested by you was a\nbounty for me!$k$pIf I didn't meet you, my harvest festival\nwould have ended after a single day.\nMy days as a bloodsucker...$k$pThey'd be dead and buried! Nya ha\nha!$k$pThat's why I'm so grateful to you. So\nI'll keep on hexing and killing. You can\nreap the rewards!
