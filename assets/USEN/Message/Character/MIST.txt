MID_MIST_HOME1: This place is amazing. Even the air—\nit's so, I don't know...fresh? We must\nbe really high up or something!
MID_MIST_HOME2: I'm not too happy being in battles, but\nI'm glad to help any way I can. You\nknow what I do love doing?$k$pCleaning and doing laundry,\nbelieve it or not!

You must have seen\nthat I was nervous at first.$k$pSome of the Heroes seemed a bit\nintimidating! But I knew I could\ntrust you from the very start.$k$pI don't really know why, but I knew it\nfrom the second I saw you. Anyway,\nI've been glad to work hard for you.$k$pSo, right... What was my point? Oh,\nyes. Thanks! And you can count on\nme to keep doing my best!
