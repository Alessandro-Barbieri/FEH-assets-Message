MID_REINHARDT2_HOME1: I have seen others burn with passion\nthat utterly consumes them...$k$pI do not believe I have this capacity.\nAnd I have come to see that as a\nweakness.
MID_REINHARDT2_HOME2: It is with good reason that Lady Ishtar\nis called the Goddess of Thunder.$k$pThe amount of magical power she\ncommands is far beyond my grasp.
MID_REINHARDT2_HOME3: Guard your health, and guard it well.\nAs long as we have you, there's little\nchance this army will be defeated.
MID_REINHARDT2_HOME4: Leif is the enemy. However, being\nhere—another place, another time—\nmay allow me to tread another path.
MID_REINHARDT2_HOME5: When the subject turns to tactical\ngeniuses, only two names ought to\nbe spoken: Saias's...and yours.
MID_REINHARDT2_FRIEND: You may think it rude that I don't\ndismount. You would be correct.$k$pStill and all, I bid you greetings on\nbehalf of $Nf.$k$pNow, if you'll excuse me, an urgent\nmission requires my attention.
MID_REINHARDT2_LEVEL1: Friege rains thunder on its foes.\nAn instant later, they are gone.
MID_REINHARDT2_LEVEL2: To wield both blade and tome...\nThis is what it means to be a\nmage knight.
MID_REINHARDT2_LEVEL3: I beg you—give me a chance to\nreclaim my honor.
MID_REINHARDT2_SKILL: My gratitude is boundless. I\npromise excellent results.
MID_REINHARDT2_JOIN: I am Reinhardt of Friege, the mage\nknight.$k$pLest you think my talents are limited\nto magic, let me demonstrate to you\nmy skill with a blade.
MID_REINHARDT2_STRONGEST: Long ago, I fought Prince Leif and\nhis army at the River Thracia.$k$pWe had the advantage. My forces\noutnumbered his, and my position\nwas more favorable.$k$pAnd yet I was defeated. But how? To\nwhat do I ascribe my failure?$k$pThinking about it now, I believe the\nquestion is one of spirit.$k$pWhatever the odds against them,\nPrince Leif's forces possessed a\nwill strong enough to grasp victory.$k$pTheir determination shone, and it was\nsomething I lacked. That, I suppose,\nis my weakness.$k$pHowever, fighting by your side has\nhelped me conquer this failing in\nmyself.$k$pMy will is strong. As long as it lasts,\nI will bring you victory.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE01: はぁっ！
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE02: Sorry!
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE04: A blunder...
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE05: Forgive me.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE06: Excuse me.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE07: I'll show you how it's done.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE08: Forward, now!
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE09: My regrets...
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE10: Chuckle
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE11: I am Reinhardt, a knight of Friege.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE12: Eh? You have the mischievous heart of a child.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE13: In battle, a mage-knight should be equipped with more than just magic, my friend.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE14: I can fight at my utmost thanks to you.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE15: Your stratagems... It's almost as though you can espy the battlefield as a whole.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE16: Olwen... It seems you've chosen your own path, my sister.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE17: Perhaps the person I ought to serve...is you.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE18: Understood.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE19: You are good.
MID_REINHARDT2_VOICE20: As you planned.
