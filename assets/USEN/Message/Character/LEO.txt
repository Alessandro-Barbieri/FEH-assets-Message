MID_LEO_HOME1: My, my, there are quite a number of\nhandsome devils here. But none so\nhandsome as myself, it seems.
MID_LEO_HOME2: Valbar lost his family to a band of\npirates. His cause is my own, and that\nincludes his revenge.
MID_LEO_HOME3: Humm, you're looking a bit pale...\nFatigue is the sworn enemy of beauty,\nso get some rest.
MID_LEO_HOME4: Would you show me around town?\nI need to pick up some new clothes,\nnew accessories, some...$k$pWell, let's just say keeping up\nappearances is a full-time job.
MID_LEO_HOME5: Oh, I always keep up on the latest\ntrends. I need to know what's in style\nhere. It wouldn't do to fall behind.
MID_LEO_FRIEND: You're $Nu?\nI bring a message to you from\n$Nf.\n
MID_LEO_LEVEL1: Is there no one who can\nbest me?
MID_LEO_LEVEL2: Well, I suppose this is the\nexpected result.
MID_LEO_LEVEL3: This feels funny...\nAnd not the ha-ha kind.
MID_LEO_SKILL: Oh, my, I have been made\nstronger? Why, sometimes\nI even startle myself!
MID_LEO_JOIN: I'm Leon, an archer by trade. And\nlet me start by saying, you have\npulled me away from Valbar...$k$pI will not forgive you if any harm\nshould befall him in my absence.
MID_LEO_STRONGEST: Hello, $Nu!\nI've prepared some tea. Would you\ncare to join me?$k$pI must admit, I was anxious when you\nfirst summoned me here.$k$pUgh, don't laugh—it's rude! I may not\nlook worried, but I have my fair share\nof concern, same as anyone else.$k$pAnyway, you've proven yourself more\nthan capable, so I suppose I don't\nmind sticking around.$k$pTo be honest, I am eager to return\nhome... But that can wait, I think...$k$pCare for another cup?
MID_LEO_VOICE01: えーいっ
MID_LEO_VOICE02: Like this?
MID_LEO_VOICE03: Damn you!
MID_LEO_VOICE04: きゃああああーっ！
MID_LEO_VOICE05: Hands off!
MID_LEO_VOICE06: We're done here.
MID_LEO_VOICE07: Excuse me?
MID_LEO_VOICE08: Get lost!
MID_LEO_VOICE09: Madness.
MID_LEO_VOICE10: Mmm.
MID_LEO_VOICE11: Hey, hey, now. No more of that.
MID_LEO_VOICE12: I'm a friendly fellow, but not the touchy-feely type. All right?
MID_LEO_VOICE13: Is it really so terrible to be this stylish?
MID_LEO_VOICE14: Valbar is my dearest friend. If he's happy, I'm happy.
MID_LEO_VOICE15: All this fighting can't be good for my skin.
MID_LEO_VOICE16: Oh, Valbar. I wonder what you're up to right now.
MID_LEO_VOICE17: You're a bit of a riddle, aren't you? Good. I like riddles.
MID_LEO_VOICE18: Sure.
MID_LEO_VOICE19: Oh?
MID_LEO_VOICE20: Let's go.
