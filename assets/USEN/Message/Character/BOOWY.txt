MID_BOOWY_HOME1: The Order of Heroes, a different\nworld... This is like a dream,\nand it's more than I can fathom now.
MID_BOOWY_HOME2: I'm a fisherman's son, from a little\nisland called Novis.$k$pWith two brothers, life wasn't easy for\nmy family, so I ended up at the Priory.\n
MID_BOOWY_HOME3: I've seen how hard you work. Be\ncareful with that. Work too hard, and\nyou'll wear yourself out.$k$pThen nothing will get done.\n
MID_BOOWY_HOME4: When I need calm, I just go and look\nat the sea. But now that I'm here in\nthis world, how do I even find it?$k$pMaybe you can take me.
MID_BOOWY_HOME5: I was just reading my grimoire.\nIf I don't keep my studies up,\nI'm going to hear it from Nomah.
MID_BOOWY_FRIEND: I bring greetings from\n$Nf.$k$pThat's all I got.
MID_BOOWY_LEVEL1: Nice! I can celebrate a little now,\ncan't I?
MID_BOOWY_LEVEL2: No better than adequate.
MID_BOOWY_LEVEL3: Need to try again... And study harder\nnext time.
MID_BOOWY_SKILL: Knowing you believe in me makes\nme feel like I'll become even stronger.
MID_BOOWY_JOIN: I'm Boey, a mage. I usually try to\navoid problematic situations. You\ncalled me here, so...so much for that.
MID_BOOWY_STRONGEST: My family... Well, I'll be honest with\nyou. We were poor as poor gets,\nso off to the priory I went.$k$pThey said I had a talent for magic.\nDon't get me wrong. I didn't suffer\nover it. But I did wonder...$k$pIf I was born somewhere else, what\nwould my life have been like? I gave\nup thinking about it. There's no point.$k$pBut then I was summoned here—a\nworld full of different people. Fighting\nalongside them has been great.$k$pAnd I have to thank you for that.\nWe've been together for a long time\nnow. You're not just someone I know.$k$pNow...I think of you more like...family.\n
