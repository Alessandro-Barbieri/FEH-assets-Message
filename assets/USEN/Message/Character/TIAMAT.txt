MID_TIAMAT_HOME1: The Order of Heroes isn't doing all\nof this to gain rewards or gather\naccolades.$k$pIt's purely in the interest of saving\npeople. I find that marvelous.
MID_TIAMAT_HOME2: Our mercenary group has an\nunusual reputation. We're known to\ndo jobs without payment.$k$pAnd we sometimes take a job only\nto help save people. But we never\ndo it solely for the money.
MID_TIAMAT_HOME3: Anything I can assist you with? I'm\nglad to handle any task, for all jobs\nare crucial among mercenaries.$k$pWhy, I've even been known to help\nMist with laundry on occasion. No\ndirtier task than that in our group.
MID_TIAMAT_HOME4: Training must become instinct for\nthose who want to survive on the\nbattlefield.$k$pAnd so, we must master our\nabilities, our very bodies, until\nour training is in our blood.
MID_TIAMAT_HOME5: I wish our mercenary group's old\ncommander, Greil, could see how\nwell his son has developed.$k$pHe has carried on Greil's legacy\nvery nicely as our leader.

MID_TIAMAT_STRONGEST: Today I'd like to show you what\nit's like to wield an axe,\n$Nu.$k$pFirst lesson! Make sure you swing\nthe axe so the axe doesn't swing\nyou.$k$pNow, give my axe a try. Good,\nbut set your hips so it makes a\nbase that will not sway.$k$pOh? Ready to stop so soon?\nWorking such training into your\nbones and blood could save you.$k$pBut I suppose that's my job, and\nI'm glad that you've summoned\nme into this world to do it.$k$pIt's long been my desire to fight\nwith pride, saving people, with no\nregard for money or honor.$k$pHow lucky I am to have found a\nfriend in you.$k$pSo, if you wish it, I'll protect your\nlife, as one of your truest friends,\nfor as long as you'll have me.
