MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_HOME1: So war has come to this world as well,\nand its people suffer for it. Seems\nthere's work for me to do here.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_HOME2: My father once led the Greil\nMercenaries. Every person under his\ncommand trusted him fully.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_HOME3: Let me take some chores off your\nhands so you can take a break. I'll...\nHmm... I'll go chop some firewood!
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_HOME4: This is Urvan, my father's axe... It's\nrugged and strong. It reminds me of\nhim.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_HOME5: Using an axe is different from using a\nsword. This guy requires power over\nskill. I need to get stronger.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_FRIEND: I'm Ike, from the Greil Mercenaries.\nI have a message for you. It's from\n$Nf.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_LEVEL1: Swinging this axe is becoming\nsecond nature.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_LEVEL2: Seems my body is finally getting\nused to this.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_LEVEL3: My training still has a long way to\ngo.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_SKILL: I guess that means I need to work\na bit harder around here now.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_JOIN: I'm Ike of the Greil Mercenaries. And\nthis axe is Urvan. You might call it my\ncurrent partner.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_STRONGEST: I had the strangest dream... It was of\nanother world, and there were entire\ncrowds calling my name.$k$pCountless people, all cheering for me.\nCan you believe it? I don't pretend to\nunderstand magic, but...$k$pWell, it wouldn't surprise me if that\ncheering is why I was summoned\nto this world.$k$pBut if that is the case...I have to\nmake sure I don't let them down.$k$pI'm no knight, and certainly no\nnobleman. My father was my only\nexample of how a man should be.$k$pSo I need to carry out his vision and\nmake sure our mercenary company is\nsomething he would be proud of.$k$pTo fight for the people, not for the\nmoney... That is my desire.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE01: おおぉっ！
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE02: 行くぞ！
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE04: 倒れるわけには…！

MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE09: Argh... I'm sorry...
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE10: Haha
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE11: This reminds me of something my father wore.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE12: Hmm? What is it? Do you need something?
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE13: I had a strange dream. Thousands of people... And they were all saying my name!
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE14: I was called to this world to answer the wishes of many. Or so it seems.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE15: I can't really remember that dream I had. But I do remember that you helped me.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE16: Father, watch over me. One day, I swear...
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE17: I'm grateful to you. You've done so much for me. You are a true friend.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE18: Understood.
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE19: Orders?
MID_IKE_POPULARITY01_VOICE20: It's all for you.
