MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_HOME1: I once thought this outfit too somber,\nbut I've come to think it suits me. I\ncan show a different side of myself...
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_HOME2: On stage, I cover my face with a veil.\nMy mother was a songstress with no\nequal, you see...$k$pI don't want that to color people's\nopinions of me.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_HOME3: There's always a price to be paid for\npower. You can summon Heroes, but\nat what cost to yourself?$k$pI hope I don't have to worry about you.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_HOME4: Come, let's go for a walk together. It's\ntoo bad my pegasus isn't here... We\ncould have strolled the skies.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_HOME5: Ah, it's you. I was just practicing my\nsinging. I wonder how far my voice\ncould reach...
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_FRIEND: You are the ocean's gray waves...\nAh, you've caught me in a song. I've\nsimply come to say hello...
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_LEVEL1: Wonderful. I can only grow by\nexperiencing many things.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_LEVEL2: I have a little catch in my throat...
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_LEVEL3: I am sorry. My feelings are muted\njust now. Ah, well.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_SKILL: I'm glad. This can only mean that\nyou have high expectations of me.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_JOIN: I'm Shigure. My songs hold\nmysterious power. Would you like me\nto sing one for you?
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_STRONGEST: You've come to hear me sing some\nmore? I like that you come alone. It\nhelps me concentrate.$k$pI prefer singing for just one person. I\nknow that you must be wondering why\nI performed at that festival, then...$k$pI'm searching for someone—my\nmother. She went missing after the\nwar ended.$k$pYou see, I thought that maybe, just\nmaybe...if I sang there, and if I used\nthe power I have...$k$pThen maybe I'd see her in the\naudience. That's why I was there. I\nsound like a fool, don't I?$k$pI may not have found my mother, but\nI did find you. You need me, so I'll\nsing for you while I can.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE01: えいっ！
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE02: せやあっ！
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE03: ううっ！
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE04: Why?
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE05: My heart is singing...
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE06: Time for a requiem.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE07: The end of melody...
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE08: Forgive me.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE09: Remember me.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE10: Ehee
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE11: Glad to sing for you.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE12: Don't exhaust yourself.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE13: My mother's singing brimmed with power. I thought that my singing...had no such effect.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE14: I love festivals. But less so, crowds.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE15: Please, there's no need to worry yourself over me.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE16: I'd like to sing my heart out somewhere. In some ruins, perhaps.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE17: I don't like singing for an audience. Unless, of course, that audience is you. You are often in my thoughts.
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE18: What now?
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE19: Shall I sing?
MID_SHIGURE_DANCE_VOICE20: What a stage.
