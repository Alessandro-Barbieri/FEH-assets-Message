MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_HOME1: I didn't think I'd like this kimono at\nfirst, but the white makes me look like\nI belong in the Order of Heroes.$k$pCamilla, reporting for duty,\nCommander! Heehee, just\npracticing...
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_HOME2: We were celebrating the new year in\nkimono as a symbol of friendship with\nHoshido.$k$pIt's important to understand each\nother's cultures if you want to get\nalong.
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_HOME3: It's important to take your duties\nseriously, but it's New Year's! You\nmust take some time to relax, dear.$k$pI was hoping to have time to get to\nknow you better.
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_HOME4: Be a dear and help me adjust my\nsash, will you? Huh? Oh, what are\nyou blushing for?
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_HOME5: Admiring my weapon? It's called a\nkadomatsu. Technically it's a\ndecoration, but...$k$pWell, the tip is so sharp, it simply\nseemed inefficient to not use it as a\nweapon!
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_FRIEND: I've come with a greeting for the new\nyear! Now, promise you'll be a good\nfriend to $Nf.
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL1: This year is bound to be filled with\nwonderful things.
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL2: This year is sure to be different\nfrom the last.
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL3: Perhaps I'll take a more relaxed\napproach to this year...
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_SKILL: New power for a new year.\nHeehee... Thank you.
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_JOIN: I'm Camilla, Princess of Nohr. But this\nyear we're celebrating New Year's\nwith some Hoshidan flair!
MID_CAMILLA_NEWYEAR01_STRONGEST: Ahh, $Nu!\nAre you enjoying the new year?$k$pWe may come from different cultures,\nbut spending the new year with family\nseems to be common all around.$k$pAnd yet, I realize you have no family\nof your own here to spend it with.$k$pI was worried you might be feeling\nlonely. So, if there's ever anything I\ncan do, don't hesitate to tell me.$k$pAfter all, you and I are practically\nfamily by now, aren't we? Maybe I\nshould start tucking you in at night.$k$pThat may even help ensure our first\ndreams of the new year are of each\nother! Wouldn't that be lovely?$k$pMy New Year's wish is to be closer to\nyou than any other Hero. Do you think\nyou can help make it come true?
