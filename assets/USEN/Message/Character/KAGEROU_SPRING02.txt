MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE11: I am Kagero. This outfit is strange, I know. It's for the spring festival.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE12: Hey! What do you think you're doing?
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE13: When at a festival, it is only correct to observe local custom. That's why I'm dressed like this, you see.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE14: As a ninja, I'm not used to being seen. But you may look, if you like. I have nothing to be ashamed of.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE15: You think this outfit suits me? It's...a little flimsier than what I'm used to.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE16: No matter how I may be dressed, I carry the honor of my clan with me. Always.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE17: If you have no objections to this attire, then I would continue to serve at your side.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE18: Of course.
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE19: As petals fall...
MID_KAGEROU_SPRING02_VOICE20: Spring into action.
