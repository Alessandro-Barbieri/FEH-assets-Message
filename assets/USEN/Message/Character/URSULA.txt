MID_URSULA_HOME3: I find you perfect in so many ways\nand so wonderful to serve. But\nif you get too tired...?$k$pWell, I'm just saying that your flaws\nwould start to show. And we\nCAN'T have that.
MID_URSULA_HOME4: I belong to the Black Fang, a group of\nassassins. I'm among their very elite,\nknown as the Four Fangs.$k$pI'd be the weakest of the four in a\ndirect fight. But what assassin worth\nher salt is EVER direct?
MID_URSULA_HOME5: Now, you keep striving for absolute\nperfection in all things, and I'll\nfollow you to the ends of the world.
MID_URSULA_FRIEND: Ah. I was sent to say hello by— Hmm.\nNice army here. I wonder how long\nit'd take me to finish them off...

You don't battle, but\nyour tactics are exquisite!$k$pBut...$k$pI will say that if you falter, even in\nthe slightest, you do know how\nour little arrangement ends, right?$k$pHmm, yes, I think you do. Then\nbest you make yourself productive.\nThe Blue Crow...is watching.
