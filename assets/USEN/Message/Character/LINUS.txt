MID_LINUS_HOME1: My brother is very skilled. Nobody\ncan beat him—not even me. And he\nnever makes mistakes.
MID_LINUS_HOME2: You could say that my brother Lloyd\nand I are well known, at least to those\nwho travel in certain circles...$k$pWe're the Reed brothers of the Black\nFang.
MID_LINUS_HOME3: Show me your weapon.$k$pWhat is this thing? Don't tell me you\nuse it to fight!
MID_LINUS_HOME4: Places like this... So pretty, so proper...\nThey just aren't for me. Give me a\ntarget! I need something to do.
MID_LINUS_HOME5: It's not that I enjoy violence... But I\nhave to uphold our code. Dispensing\nthe Fang's justice is my job.
MID_LINUS_FRIEND: Bring me $Nu!\nI've come with greetings. That's\nright—the Mad Dog is here in person!
MID_LINUS_LEVEL1: Now everyone will know what the\nMad Dog is capable of!
MID_LINUS_LEVEL2: Nowhere near good enough—not\nyet!
MID_LINUS_LEVEL3: Is this a joke? It's a bad one.
MID_LINUS_SKILL: More strength to take care of\nthe Fang's business...
MID_LINUS_JOIN: I'm Linus, the one and only Mad Dog\nof the Four Fangs! I'm ready to go—\nshow me the filth, and I'll deal with it.
MID_LINUS_STRONGEST: I'm fighting at my peak, day after day.\nI was on edge when I first got here,\nbut you've put me at ease.$k$pYou make a good leader.$k$pI'm stronger than just about anyone,\nbut I'm not a deep thinker. I leave that\nto my brother and my father.$k$pI can be impulsive, and it's gotten me\ninto trouble, I'll admit.$k$pBut I can tell that you're sharp, and\nyour heart is in the right place, too.$k$pI've seen the worst of humanity, and\nyou're one of the good ones. Believe\nme—I know.$k$pThat's why I trust you, and why I\nfight just as hard for you as I do\nfor my brother.$k$pEnough talk. Where's our next\ntarget? I promise to bring down the\nFang's justice on them!
