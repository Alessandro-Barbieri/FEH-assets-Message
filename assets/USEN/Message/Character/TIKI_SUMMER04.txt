MID_TIKI_SUMMER04_HOME2: I had to stay asleep inside the Fane\nfor a very long time, so I don't know\nmuch about what it's like outside.$k$pThat's why I'm trying to have as much\nfun as I possibly can!
MID_TIKI_SUMMER04_HOME3: Hey, you're looking kind of red... You\nweren't in the sun without proper\nprotection, were you?!
MID_TIKI_SUMMER04_HOME4: I spotted a big white bird outside, so\nI'm gonna try talking to it. Wanna\ncome with me?
MID_TIKI_SUMMER04_HOME5: I made a Mar-Mar statue out of sand!\nWill you help me protect it from the\nwater?
