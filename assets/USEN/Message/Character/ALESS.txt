MID_ALESS_HOME1: To think I would meet my father\nhere... He is just as Mother described\nhim. No, better.$k$pHe is the embodiment of the ideal\nknight, without question.
MID_ALESS_HOME2: Successor to the throne of Nordion I\nmay be, yet I have spent all my life\nliving battle to battle, as a mercenary.$k$pI suppose that's why surroundings\nsuch as these feel so unnatural to\nme...
MID_ALESS_HOME3: I see you wandering back and forth,\nback and forth... With battle ahead of\nyou, you ought to use this time to rest.
MID_ALESS_HOME4: It's a waste of time to stand there\nwatching. Train with me. There is no\ndrawback to forging your body.
MID_ALESS_HOME5: I'm maintaining my blade. Demon\nSword though it may be called, it is\nmerely a weapon.$k$pYou should put some consideration to\nhow you treat that "divine weapon" of\nyours.
MID_ALESS_FRIEND: I am Ares. I bear a greeting on behalf\nof $Nf.
MID_ALESS_LEVEL1: Now you understand my strength!
MID_ALESS_LEVEL2: Mystletainn, the Demon Sword...\nIt thirsts for the blood of men.
MID_ALESS_LEVEL3: No... This is not acceptable!
MID_ALESS_SKILL: You granted me this power... I will\nshow you what I can do with it.
MID_ALESS_JOIN: I am the black knight, Ares. Know that\nall who stand in my way will be naught\nbut stains on the Demon Sword.
MID_ALESS_STRONGEST: Well met, $Nu.$k$pI will admit that I despised you at\nfirst—because you don't fight.$k$pI came to realize, though, that you are\na warrior in your way, and a fine one\nat that. Pardon my rudeness.$k$pIn my thought, I have a tendency\ntoward...rigidity. I've lost loved ones\nand even raised my sword at friends.$k$pLoyalty is what drives a knight to take\nup arms. However, loyalty can\nbecome a prison... It happened to me.$k$pYou, though... You perceive things\nfrom a distance. When I came to\nunderstand why you fight...$k$pI decided that I would be the blade\nthat destroys your foes.$k$pI swear this on Mystletainn, the\nDemon Sword, and also on my\nname—Ares, the black knight.

MID_ALESS_VOICE12: What do you think you're doing? Do not accost me.
MID_ALESS_VOICE13: Sigurd was my father's sworn enemy, or so I believed for all my life. But now...
MID_ALESS_VOICE14: Could it be possible? Is my father here, in this world?
MID_ALESS_VOICE15: My late father's goals are my own. I will restore my realm.
MID_ALESS_VOICE16: Mystletainn, the Demon Sword...it thirsts for the blood of men.

MID_ALESS_VOICE19: Point me at the enemy.
MID_ALESS_VOICE20: I will go.
