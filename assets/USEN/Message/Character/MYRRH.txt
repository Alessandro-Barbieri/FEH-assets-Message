MID_MYRRH_HOME1: Father... Brother... I miss you.
MID_MYRRH_HOME2: The Darkling Woods, where I was\nborn, are very peaceful. Well, they\nwere...until one day...
MID_MYRRH_HOME3: Are you doing OK? Oh, no... Don't\nworry. It's just that you looked so sad\nto me.
MID_MYRRH_HOME4: Um... I have a request. Would you\nmind watching over me while I take a\nnap? I don't like sleeping alone.
MID_MYRRH_HOME5: I was looking at the sky. It's a pretty\nkind of blue...$k$pI wonder if it stretches all the way\nback to the woods I come from.
MID_MYRRH_FRIEND: I'm Myrrh. I come with greetings from\n$Nf...$k$pOh, and hello from me, too.

MID_MYRRH_LEVEL3: Aww... Did anything even\nchange?
MID_MYRRH_SKILL: Did this power come from\nhumans...or monsters?
MID_MYRRH_JOIN: I'm Myrrh, from Darkling Woods.\nWhat? It's impolite to ask a woman\nher age. That's what Ephraim says.$k$pI think you're being rude.
MID_MYRRH_STRONGEST: You worry about me a lot, don't you?\nI'm fine. I promise.$k$pPeople are born every day. They\nlaugh, they cry, and someday...they\ndie. I've seen it so many times...$k$pDragons...are both human and\nmonster. And so we are also neither,\nand part of neither community.$k$pThat used to make me sad. It doesn't\nanymore. I think it's better this way.$k$pI will watch over everyone, until the\nvery end... And I will live with their\nmemories.$k$pYou work harder than anybody else.\nI love to see that. I promise that I will\nalways, always remember you.
