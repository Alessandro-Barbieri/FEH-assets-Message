MID_MARICA_HOME1: This dry wind... It reminds me of the\ndeserts of Jehanna.
MID_MARICA_HOME2: I wonder how Gerik and his band are\ndoing.
MID_MARICA_HOME3: Your hands... They're blistered. You're\nholding your weapon wrong. Wrap\nthe grip in hide.
MID_MARICA_HOME4: I'm good for fighting and not much\nelse. If you want to spar, you can\ncome and find me.
MID_MARICA_HOME5: Do you need something? Don't just\nlook at me. Makes me uneasy.
MID_MARICA_FRIEND: Uh...$Nu?\nI'm with $Nf.
MID_MARICA_LEVEL1: Good. But I have a lot more work\nto do to master the blade.
MID_MARICA_LEVEL2: Not good. Not bad. Not what I\nwas hoping for.
MID_MARICA_LEVEL3: I can't let the chief see me like\nthis...
MID_MARICA_SKILL: With this...am I inching closer to\nmy father?
MID_MARICA_JOIN: I am Marisa, a swordswoman of\nGerik's mercenaries. If you need\nmy help, I have a blade.
MID_MARICA_STRONGEST: I'm used to you watching me practice.\nNo idea why you think it's interesting\nto watch me swing a sword, though.$k$pI practice every day. I've fought a\nthousand men, and I won every single\ntime.$k$pIf I'm facing an enemy, I refuse to\ngive in. And if I have to confront\nmyself...I won't give in either.$k$pBattles happen once. They're no time\nto test your skills—you win, or you\nlose. It's black and white.$k$pI don't know where the road you're\non will lead. And some day, you may\nhave to face yourself.$k$pWhen that day comes, the only one\nyou can depend on...is you.$k$pKeep getting stronger. Until you have\nwalked your path as far as it can take\nyou.

MID_MARICA_VOICE13: I'm not upset. This is just...how I am.
MID_MARICA_VOICE14: I don't dislike talking with you... So let's chat.
MID_MARICA_VOICE15: What can I do...to help?
