MID_LUKA_HOME1: This world exists in a state of\ndivision too? Perhaps it is simply\nhuman to be torn in two.
MID_LUKA_HOME2: I am of a noble family...at least in\nthe world where I am from.$k$pOur home is near the border, so I\njoined the Deliverance when\ncrisis erupted in our lands.
MID_LUKA_HOME3: You are not from this place, and yet\nyou have committed yourself to\ntheir cause. Very honorable.
MID_LUKA_HOME4: The weather is often pleasant here.\nWe should venture out on a stroll.\nSuch things sooth the spirit.
MID_LUKA_HOME5: I like to lose myself in the books\nhere when I can. It should be no\nsurprise. Even I like a good escape.
MID_LUKA_FRIEND: I have been sent to deliver\na hello from your friend\n$Nf.$k$pHow nice to get best wishes\nfor the future.
MID_LUKA_LEVEL1: This much growth seems almost\nexcessive, don't you think?
MID_LUKA_LEVEL2: I will take an average gain\nover none any day.
MID_LUKA_LEVEL3: Less than moderate growth.\nHmm. I can do better.
MID_LUKA_SKILL: You have placed your faith in me.\nAnd so, I place my faith in you.
MID_LUKA_JOIN: My name is Lukas. I'm among those\nwho fight for the Deliverance. While\nhere, I pledge myself to your cause.
MID_LUKA_STRONGEST: What perfect timing you have,\n$Nu.$k$pI was ready for a break from\nthe usual routine. Chat with me\na moment, won't you?$k$pI've noticed that you and I both are\nwalking a similar path here.$k$pWe are both Heroes, are we not?\nBoth of us, summoned here.$k$pAnd both, constrained by the habits\nand patterns of that place, only to\nwake a bit upon landing here.$k$pStill, one can't regret the past,\nties that bind and all. We must\ncarry on.$k$pDon't you agree? Ha! Well, perhaps\nI overspoke.$k$pOr is it that we too deeply\nsympathize—and there is really\nno need for much ado?$k$pIn any case, I'm glad to be with\nyou. Right here, right now.

MID_LUKA_VOICE10: Heehee
MID_LUKA_VOICE11: Yes? What do you require?
MID_LUKA_VOICE12: Hmm? You needn't needle me.
MID_LUKA_VOICE13: What shall we do...? Find some sort of diversion?
MID_LUKA_VOICE14: The Kingdom of Zofia is blessed with great beauty.
MID_LUKA_VOICE15: My friends have strong personalities. They would try even the most patient of men.
