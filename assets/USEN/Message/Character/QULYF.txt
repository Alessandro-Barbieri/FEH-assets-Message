MID_QULYF_HOME1: The chance to meet with so many\nHeroes from a variety of cultures...\nI actually find it kind of interesting.
MID_QULYF_HOME2: Life in the village was getting boring,\nso when Alm asked me to join the\nDeliverance, I took the plunge.
MID_QULYF_HOME3: Being a summoner sounds like it's\npretty interesting. Mind if we switch\njobs for a day? Yes, I'm kidding.
MID_QULYF_HOME4: I've spent so much time in the library\nhere. I'm getting bored. Why don't\nyou show me around?$k$pI bet they let you go anywhere.
MID_QULYF_HOME5: I'm taking notes on this place, but\nwhen I get back to my world...\nnobody is going to believe me.
MID_QULYF_FRIEND: I was asked to carry this greeting by\n$Nf.$k$pCan I go now?
MID_QULYF_LEVEL1: Impressive! I didn't know I had\nthis kind of potential.
MID_QULYF_LEVEL2: This is nothing to complain about.\nDid you expect more?
MID_QULYF_LEVEL3: What? How boring.
MID_QULYF_SKILL: Now this looks interesting... As a\nfavor, I'll use it to help you out.
MID_QULYF_JOIN: My name is Kliff. Hmm... This place\nlooks like it could be a lot of fun.\nDon't let me get bored.
MID_QULYF_STRONGEST: Hey, $Nu...\nWant to talk?$k$pHonestly, I wanted to ask you\nsomething. Do I have a bad attitude?$k$pMy friends say I do. It's true, isn't it?$k$pI don't know why, but just about\neverything irritates me.$k$pMaybe it's because I'm young. I'm\nnot free to do what I want... I feel like\nI'm still waiting to grow up.$k$pMy dream is to travel the world on\nmy own. I won't be going back to my\nvillage. That's a secret, by the way.$k$pWhen I can go wherever I please,\nI'll try and find the time to visit you\nagain. Probably.$k$pDon't be surprised if I turn up!
MID_QULYF_VOICE01: Urya!
MID_QULYF_VOICE02: I'm coming...
MID_QULYF_VOICE03: Uwah!
MID_QULYF_VOICE04: Damn it...
MID_QULYF_VOICE05: You watching?
MID_QULYF_VOICE06: I'll play with you.
MID_QULYF_VOICE07: You're no big deal.
MID_QULYF_VOICE08: Get out of here!
MID_QULYF_VOICE09: I guess this is it.
MID_QULYF_VOICE10: Hehe
MID_QULYF_VOICE11: I'm Kliff. I'm a member of the Deliverance, along with everybody â€” well, it's a long story.
MID_QULYF_VOICE12: Huh? Don't be such a Tobin. If you're bored, why don't you try studying? It'll sharpen your wits.
MID_QULYF_VOICE13: I used to go to the school in the village, but it shut down, all thanks to the war. I'm so bored.
MID_QULYF_VOICE14: I'm not sure I believe what you're telling me about the world you come from. Are you pulling my leg?
MID_QULYF_VOICE15: My friends from the village all treat me like a child. It's rather rude, wouldn't you say?
MID_QULYF_VOICE16: I want to see the wide world with my own eyes. If that means I won't see my friends again, well, so be it.
MID_QULYF_VOICE17: You're not as boring as I expected! When I'm around you, things are never dull. Keep being yourself, OK?
MID_QULYF_VOICE18: That might work.
MID_QULYF_VOICE19: Hmm...
MID_QULYF_VOICE20: I'll take care of it.
