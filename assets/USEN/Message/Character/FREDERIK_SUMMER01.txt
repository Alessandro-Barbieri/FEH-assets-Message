MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_HOME1: Hmm... There are many Heroes here,\nno doubt. But few show as much skin\nas I...
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_HOME2: The Outrealms resort was so\nexhilarating! I kept busy training on\nthe beach, smiting miscreants, and—$k$pit pains me to admit this—sinning.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_HOME3: When I consider the poor souls who,\nbarefoot, might trod on a pebble...I\nknow I must redouble my efforts.$k$pWhat efforts? To remove debris at\nevery opportunity! I can only hope this\neases your journeys, too.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_HOME4: Might you be willing to train with me?\nIt pains me to say it, but your\ndefenses are...lacking.$k$pPerhaps we can forge a body of steel\nto match your stout heart!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_HOME5: Ah, I'm fretting over Lord Chrom and\nLady Lissa. I hope they don't step on\nseashells while I'm away!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_FRIEND: I apologize for appearing before you\nlike this. I was tasked with conveying\n$Nf's tidings.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_LEVEL1: Delightful. I can't wait to run and\njump into the sea!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_LEVEL2: My beach training regimen seems\nto have paid off.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_LEVEL3: How embarrassing. Perhaps it's\nthe heat...
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_SKILL: You honor me. I'll focus on my\nefforts to clean up seashells.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_JOIN: I am Frederick. I was on the beach\nprotecting Lord Chrom. Tell me...\nWhere am I now?
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_STRONGEST: I feel that I've gotten much stronger\nsince I came here. You've put a lot\nof time and energy into my training.$k$pHonestly, I had my misgivings at\nfirst. I never expected you to take me\nseriously, dressed like this...$k$pHow wrong I was. You helped me\ntrain. Even so, I worried that you\nmight earn my trust and then...$k$pyou'd spring a terrible surprise on me.\nI spent my nights sleepless, certain\nyou'd suddenly force me to eat bear...$k$pBut thinking about it, I confess I can\nsee no reason you'd ever do that,\nSummoner.$k$pTo make amends, I'll give my utmost\non the battlefield.$k$pI've always relied on my armor, but\nnow it's my zeal that will see me\nthrough!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE01: はいっ
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE02: でやあ！
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE03: くっ…！
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE04: Always impressive.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE05: Prepare to be capsized!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE06: Go soak your head!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE07: Not on this beach!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE08: Tropical attack!
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE09: Sunset...
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE10: Hahaha
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE11: My apologies for my lack of decorum...and suitable clothing.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE12: Out of my armor, I am actually a rather accomplished swimmer.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE13: I usually dress more modestly, but I am attempting to, uh, relax.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE14: The Shepherds once visited an otherworldly tropical resort. It was...nice.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE15: I have cleared the beach of trash, as well as driftwood and shells.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE16: I wish I had managed to catch a sea creature to bring home.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE17: I hope you enjoy this summer. I will, of course, still be at your side in the fall.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE18: Of course.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE19: Whew! Hot out.
MID_FREDERIK_SUMMER01_VOICE20: Ah, shell.
