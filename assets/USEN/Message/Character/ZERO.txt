MID_ZERO_HOME1: That weapon of yours has such a\nprovocative shape. Does it feel\ngood to fire it? I bet it does.
MID_ZERO_HOME2: I serve Lord Leo. He rescued me\nfrom my former existence as a\nfilthy thief. I'd give my life for him.
MID_ZERO_HOME3: If you run yourself ragged, you\nshould be sure to take a nap. I'd be\ntickled to show you where.
MID_ZERO_HOME4: How about a midnight stroll at some\npoint? I won't bite. I never do. At least,\nnot by the light of the moon.
MID_ZERO_HOME5: That prince you serve is a pretty\nbit of porcelain. But I think he'd\nlook nicer with a few chips.
MID_ZERO_FRIEND: You must be $Nu.$k$pSomeone must be awfully fond of you\nto send me all this way. And that...\nis $Nf!
MID_ZERO_LEVEL1: My gain will be another's pain.
MID_ZERO_LEVEL2: I deserve better.
MID_ZERO_LEVEL3: How unfortunate.
MID_ZERO_SKILL: Oh! You've taken some liberties\nwith me. How nice.
MID_ZERO_JOIN: I'm Niles from the Kingdom of Nohr.\nFormer outlaw. Current disgrace.\nMy arrows are yours.
MID_ZERO_STRONGEST: Here you are. And here I am!\nAren't we a pair.$k$pI must confess that I've grown\nafter each of your visits—really\nand truly, I have!$k$pI must also say that when I first\nmet you, Summoner, I thought you\nwere a fussy bit of butter.$k$pI served you, but not happily.\nBut now! Oh, what a difference!\nI long to always be with you.$k$pI wonder, have you only indulged\nyour servant Niles? Or are we\nbecoming friends now?$k$pI know some see me as unsavory.\nTo them I say, variety is the spice\nof life! But, what say you?$k$pEh? You trust me? How curious.\nSomeone dear to me once\nsaid the very same thing.$k$pSo, you and I will be friends through\nthick and thin. And, you know me...\nI always delight my friends.

MID_ZERO_VOICE10: Ohhhh!
MID_ZERO_VOICE11: Now, now. Be gentle.
MID_ZERO_VOICE12: Yours until I break, master.
MID_ZERO_VOICE13: A little advice: wear white, and you invite mudslinging.
MID_ZERO_VOICE14: So, I came out of that weapon of yours. Scandalous.
MID_ZERO_VOICE15: Don't you just love to gaze at a full moon?
MID_ZERO_VOICE16: Where is Lord Leo? I'm sworn to protect him.

MID_ZERO_VOICE19: Yes!
MID_ZERO_VOICE20: Let's go.
