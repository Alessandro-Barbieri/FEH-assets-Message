MID_INVERSE_HOME1: No one in this country knows me. Nor\ndo they know what I have done. I find\nthat strangely comforting. Heh-heh.
MID_INVERSE_HOME2: You know, it's quite impudent of you\nto ask about my past. Oh, look at you!\nI'm just kidding. Hee-hee!
MID_INVERSE_HOME3: No matter what world you find\nyourself in, chores don't do\nthemselves. I'll do my share.
MID_INVERSE_HOME4: I've been told there is a nearby\nwaterfall. I do love them... Come,\ngive chase. We shall make a splash!
MID_INVERSE_HOME5: Are you to serve as my guard? I\nassure you—I am trustworthy. I was\njust tending to my injuries.
MID_INVERSE_FRIEND: I am Aversa. I bring you a small token\nof affection—not mine, of course.
MID_INVERSE_LEVEL1: All the naughty children who get in\nmy way will quake with terror.
MID_INVERSE_LEVEL2: Playtime is just about over... Get\nready for something new.
MID_INVERSE_LEVEL3: What a scary face! We should be\nenjoying ourselves...
MID_INVERSE_SKILL: Is this what you've been wanting?
MID_INVERSE_JOIN: Please, call me Aversa. My, you're\nadorable. If you don't watch out, I'll\ntease you mercilessly.
MID_INVERSE_STRONGEST: You come all the way out here rather\noften, don't you? I guess you don't\ntrust me. I'm not a spy, you know.$k$pThat's not it? You think I look sad?\nYou don't miss much, do you? It's\ntrue. I have many regrets.$k$pI've done terrible things to a lot of\npeople. There is no way I can atone\nfor it all...$k$pMy past clings to me. No matter what\nI do, I can't make peace with it.$k$pAnd whenever I try to speak with\nothers, well...it gets in the way.$k$pSpeak plainly, you say? As if that'd\never work.$k$pIf you're that interested in me, why\ndon't we spend a little time together?\nUntil moonrise, perhaps?$k$pAs you may have noticed, I'm the\nfiercely loyal type.

MID_INVERSE_VOICE13: My, my, you're bolder than you look, aren't you?
MID_INVERSE_VOICE14: If you wish to observe me, by all means. Just don't skulk in the shadows while you do it.
MID_INVERSE_VOICE15: Perhaps you are more than just another fool in motley, capering on the stage...
MID_INVERSE_VOICE16: You want to know about my past? That's not something that I…
MID_INVERSE_VOICE17: What would you ask of me...if I agreed to follow your every command?
