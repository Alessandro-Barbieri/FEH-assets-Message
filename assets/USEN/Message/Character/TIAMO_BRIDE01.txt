MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_HOME1: What? How do I picture my ideal\nmarriage?! Well... My husband and I\nwould always get along, and...$k$pIt'd be nice if we had a little girl.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_HOME2: Everyone keeps asking, but no, I\nwasn't summoned in the middle of a\nwedding ceremony. $k$pWhere I come from, this uniform is\nformal battle dress.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_HOME3: I can move just fine in this dress, so\nsend me into battle. I just want to\nhelp—with anything that needs doing.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_HOME4: Do you have your eye on anyone?\nJust tell me, and I'll use my bow to\nturn them your direction.$k$pNo, not really.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_HOME5: Hmm... Compared to my armor...\nAhh, $Nu!\nI was just adjusting my dress!
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_FRIEND: I bring greetings\nfrom $Nf.$k$pAm I headed to a wedding? Er...no.\nI guess I can see why you ask...
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_LEVEL1: I think I have what it takes...\nFor battle, and for love.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_LEVEL2: I guess training in this dress\ngives decent results.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_LEVEL3: At this rate... Will I find the one\nto return my love?
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_SKILL: Thanks to all you've done for me,\nI can wear this dress with pride.
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_JOIN: I am Cordelia. I know, I know! But\ndon't worry. I can fight just fine in this.\nIt's not a wedding dress!
MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_STRONGEST: I've finished my patrol. I've checked\nour supplies, too. I've been looking\nfor you, $Nu.$k$pWhat? That's not a job for a bride?\nDon't kid around. You know I'm a\nsoldier.$k$pWait.. Is it that you don't want me to\nspoil my dress?$k$pI'm right? Er... How embarrassing!\nBut thanks for the compliment, all the\nsame.$k$pWell, why not? You've been so nice\nto me... I'll try being a bride for you.$k$pHa! You're blushing! How cute.$k$pShall we walk onto the battlefield,\narm-in-arm? Maybe we do make\na good couple...

MID_TIAMO_BRIDE01_VOICE15: A proposal ought to be done only when the time is right, never sooner.
