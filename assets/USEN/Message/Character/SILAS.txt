MID_SILAS_HOME1: Whether as a knight or as a Hero, my\nmission remains unchanged—fight on\nbehalf of all citizens. I'll do my best.
MID_SILAS_HOME2: I was a castle knight back in Nohr.\nBut I was still green... Someday I'll be\na knight my friend can be proud of.
MID_SILAS_HOME3: I hear you're from another world too.\nGetting used to a new place isn't\neasy, so let's help each other out.
MID_SILAS_HOME4: How about we invite some other\nHeroes to head into town together\nsometime soon...$k$pI'd like to see someplace other than a\nbattlefield. Give it some thought, OK?
MID_SILAS_HOME5: Oh, I was just checking up on my\nhorse's gear. Finding replacements\nfor my own gear is tough enough.$k$pI need everything I came here with to\nlast until I can return home.
MID_SILAS_FRIEND: Friends are the treasure of a lifetime,\nso be sure to care for yours. Tidings\nfrom $Nf.
MID_SILAS_LEVEL1: I'm a step closer to being a great\nknight!
MID_SILAS_LEVEL2: I'm stronger today than I was\nyesterday.
MID_SILAS_LEVEL3: Hmm... Maybe I need to train\nmore?
MID_SILAS_SKILL: Thanks to your help, I'm on my\nway to becoming a proper knight.
MID_SILAS_JOIN: My name is Silas, a knight of Nohr.\nI'm a little surprised I was summoned,\nbut I'll do what I can to help!
MID_SILAS_STRONGEST: Thanks for coming to chat with me.\nIt's a good distraction. I've grown\nused to this world by now, but...$k$pThere are still a lot of Heroes around\nhere I don't know. I didn't realize how\ntense that made me.$k$pAnd you wouldn't believe how stiff\nthat's made my shoulders!$k$pHuh? You want to give me a shoulder\nrub? Heh, I must be a pretty big deal\nto garner such attention from you!$k$pI'm kidding of course... But that does\nfeel better already. Speaking with you\nis just as soothing, I might say.$k$pYou'll have to let me return the favor.\nDo you have any problems you'd like\nme to help you resolve?$k$pNo need to hold back. Ask me\nanything. After all, our friendship\nspans both space and time, right?

MID_SILAS_VOICE13: Uh... This is just how my hair grows. Please don't try to fix it.
MID_SILAS_VOICE14: Some people call me a do-gooder, but is that really a bad thing?
MID_SILAS_VOICE15: I'd hate to be your enemy. You could summon an entire army!
MID_SILAS_VOICE16: Askr has so much. I hope that, one day, Nohr will be like this.
