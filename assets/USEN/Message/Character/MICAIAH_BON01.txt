MID_MICAIAH_BON01_HOME1: The festival has everyone energized.\nI can sense all their joy! It feels like\nwe're all smiling as one.$k$pSo this is what a summer festival is\nlike, huh?
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_HOME2: Festivals are a time to forget our\ntroubles and leave our sadness\nbehind... If only for a brief moment.
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_HOME3: This outfit is so foreign to me... I'm a\nlittle nervous wearing it if I'm being\nhonest. I don't look odd in it, do I?
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_HOME4: I used to be a fortune-teller, you\nknow. Would you like me to read\nyour fortune sometime?
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_HOME5: I've never seen a dance such as this\nHoshidan one. It's so...mysterious to\nme...$k$pI cannot help but feel that Sothe\nwould be much better at performing\nit than I.
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_FRIEND: Oh, hello. I was just at the festival\nwhere I saw your friend\n$Nf.$k$pWill you be joining them soon?
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_LEVEL1: I can sense all of our hearts\njoining as one.
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_LEVEL2: I feel like I've become a better\ndancer.
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_LEVEL3: Hmm... Perhaps there's still some\nhesitation hidden in my heart...
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_SKILL: I hope my dance is enough to\nshow my appreciation.
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_JOIN: I'm Micaiah of the Dawn Brigade.\nThank you for inviting me to the\nsummer festival.$k$pHmm... I sense quite a bit of fun\nwaiting for me...
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_STRONGEST: The time I've spent with everyone\nhere—laughing, dancing, singing...it\nwill live within my heart forever.$k$pThese memories will become my\nbeacon of hope. And I sense that\none day...$k$pthis same light will shine upon\neveryone's future.$k$pEndless fighting can wear down our\nhearts, and swelling stagnation can\nlead us toward even greater calamity.$k$pHowever, the joy we feel today will\nbecome a light that never fades. One\nthat drives the darkness away.$k$pI want to step into that light with the\npeople most precious to me...$k$pEach of us carrying this summer's\nmemories deep within our hearts.

MID_MICAIAH_BON01_VOICE13: Ohh, Yune, not again! Please, settle down!
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_VOICE14: Clothing from other lands is so often different from what I'm used to... Oh, I don't mean to say I don't like it!
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_VOICE15: You think this outfit looks good on me? Why, thank you.
MID_MICAIAH_BON01_VOICE16: This is just my first impression, but... this summer festival seems deeply spiritual to the people of Hoshido.
