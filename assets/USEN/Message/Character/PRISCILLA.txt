MID_PRISCILLA_HOME1: I have heard that my brother,\nRaymond, is going by the name\nRaven these days.$k$pWhat's more, he now works as a\nmercenary. I can't imagine what\nchanged him so thoroughly!
MID_PRISCILLA_HOME2: I'm the daughter of Count Caerleon.\nBut, you see, my true lineage is\nquite a complicated story.
MID_PRISCILLA_HOME3: Oh, Raymond... My Raymond...\nWhatever happened to you,\ndear brother of mine?
MID_PRISCILLA_HOME4: I'm not skilled in battle. I find it\nall barbaric and terrifying.\nI'd rather stay in the castle.
MID_PRISCILLA_HOME5: Care to sit down for some tea?\nI have some sweets, thanks\nto the kind people here!
MID_PRISCILLA_FRIEND: My name is Priscilla. I come\nwith greetings from your\nfriend $Nf.
MID_PRISCILLA_LEVEL1: Is this an exceptional result?\nI haven't the faintest!
MID_PRISCILLA_LEVEL2: Was that an acceptable result?\nI do hope so.
MID_PRISCILLA_LEVEL3: I fear that was not nearly\ngood enough.
MID_PRISCILLA_SKILL: How curious that you're making\nme more powerful!
MID_PRISCILLA_JOIN: My name is Priscilla. If it's not too\nmuch trouble, could I stay with you\nfor a while?
MID_PRISCILLA_STRONGEST: May I ask you a question? I don't\nmean to trouble you. But...do I\nseem stronger to you?$k$pI barely recognize myself in the\nmirror, now that I've been here\nfor a while.$k$pI knew nothing of the world—or\nworlds—before all of this.\nAnd what did I know of battle?$k$pI've changed so much, and\nI believe that you deserve much\nof the credit. Don't you?$k$pWell, some goes to me. I do think\nthat you and I make a fine team.\nAnd I hope we always will!
