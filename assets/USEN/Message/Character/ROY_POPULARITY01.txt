MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_HOME1: I like to believe that heroes are born\nfrom people's wishes.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_HOME2: My father is Eliwood, the Marquess of\nPherae. He's a hero known as the\nKnight of Lycia.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_HOME3: I want to help out so you can take a\nbreak. Do you mind if I observe you\nfor a bit to get a sense of your work?
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_HOME4: This is Durandal, the sword of sacred\nfire... It's a legendary weapon. My\nfather once wielded it, too.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_HOME5: I haven't had much training in\nmounted combat. I've still got a lot to\nlearn.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_FRIEND: Are you $Nu?\nI've brought you a message from your\nfriend $Nf.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_LEVEL1: Someday I'll be just like my\nfather!
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_LEVEL2: I think I'm getting the hang of\nfighting on horseback.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_LEVEL3: I need to learn more from my\nfather's example.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_SKILL: This is all because of you.\nThank you.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_JOIN: I'm Roy. With this sword Durandal in\nhand, I will aid your army in place of\nmy father.
MID_ROY_POPULARITY01_STRONGEST: When I was young, Marcus—a knight\nwho has long served my family—told\nme many tales about my father.$k$pHe spoke of the heroic things my\nfather did in his younger days, the\nmany allies he met on his travels...$k$pAnd he told me about how my parents\nfirst met.$k$pI would get so excited hearing those\nstories. I looked forward to them far\nmore than any other tale.$k$pThat's why I admire my father so\nmuch. He's my hero.$k$pI may resemble him, but I still have so\nmuch to learn.$k$pAnd I have to get a lot stronger before\nI can truly claim to be like him. But if I\nstay by your side...$k$pI'm sure I'll be able to accomplish that\ngoal. I promise you I'll continue to do\nmy best.
