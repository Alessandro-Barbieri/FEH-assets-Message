MID_LUCINA_SPRING01_HOME1: People say the eggs I painted for the\nspring festival turn out...strange.\nBut Sharena said they look fine.
MID_LUCINA_SPRING01_HOME2: I've celebrated a spring festival only\nonce. Colorful outfits, communal\nfeasts—all of it, very nice!
MID_LUCINA_SPRING01_HOME3: You work so tirelessly. If you're\nhungry, I might have a spring-festival\negg around here somewhere.
MID_LUCINA_SPRING01_HOME4: I've heard of a most curious tradition\nthat's done during spring festivals.\nEgg rolling—heard of it?$k$pIt sounds like a carefree way to spend\nthe day. We should find a field nearby\nand try it out sometime.
MID_LUCINA_SPRING01_HOME5: Zzz...zzz... Oh! Sorry. Thinking of\nspring is so pleasant that I nod\noff. Sorry again.

MID_LUCINA_SPRING01_STRONGEST: I imagine that you could only be\ncurious about spring-festival\noutfits, $Nu.$k$pWe have many kinds of these\nfestival costumes in Ylisse.$k$pOne was an egg—cracked on one\nside. Another was a shirt that\nshowed my father...in bunny ears!$k$pPeople even go around swinging\ncarrot weapons!$k$pI'm sure that our bond would\nstrengthen if we both dressed up\nto enjoy such festivities!$k$pOh...not interested? I see. I was\nonly thinking that if our bond\nwas as strong as possible...$k$pWell, then that would be enough\nfor me if I go back home.\nI'd like to remember you forever.$k$pSorry to get melancholy. Anyway,\neven if we don't go hopping down\nthe trail together in costumes...$k$pI know our bond is strong as it is,\nand I hope you'll have me stay\nhere and help you as long as I can.
