MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_HOME1: I'm wearing the outfit, so I might as\nwell play the part. You're in for a\ntreat you won't soon forget...
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_HOME2: Outfits such as these can make\nNohrian festivals feel quite...\nprovocative. Don't you agree?$k$pDon't be afraid to let your wild side\ntake over for a bit.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_HOME3: I tracked down the sweetest treat I\ncould find, just for you. It looks\ndelicious, no? Let me feed it to you.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_HOME4: You want me to teach you some\npranks? My, my, don't we have a\nnaughty side.$k$pHowever, I must warn you to exercise\ncaution... One taste of my particular\nbrand and you may become addicted.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_HOME5: A trick...or a treat... I wonder which\nthe young prince desires?
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_FRIEND: I have a message for you from\n$Nf.$k$pGo on, take it. Don't keep me from\nmy fun.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_LEVEL1: Isn't festival time simply the best?
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_LEVEL2: I thought I could manage, but at this\nrate...I'm likely to burst.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_LEVEL3: This is simply stifling... Don't blame\nme for what happens next.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_SKILL: I can't be stopped now. I will not\nyield until my harvest bears fruit!
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_JOIN: The name's Niles... Is it a trick you\nwant or a treat? Whichever it is your\nheart desires...I'll see it done.
MID_ZERO_HALLOWEEN02_STRONGEST: There's no time of year quite like\nfestival time. The wild enthusiasm\nignites the very soul.$k$pIt allows us to show a whole new side\nof ourselves...to become entirely\nnew people.$k$pThere's no need to hide who you are\nin the first place, as far as I'm\nconcerned.$k$pBring out your true self, the you\nthat truly burns deep inside. If you\nkeep it locked up...$k$pIt can get so hot you'll feel as though\nit will burn you from the inside out.$k$pYou are not a truly virtuous person.\nYour one true wish is not for peace.\nDeep down, you yearn for more.$k$pThis is not the only time of the year\nyou wear a mask...$k$pI'm right, aren't I? It's a good thing,\nbeing true to yourself. I'll reach down\ndeep and harvest it out of you myself.$k$pThere is no need to hide who you\nare...no need to restrain yourself...\nwhen it comes to us.
