MID_NACIEN_HOME4: Grraaah! Bwaah!$k$pEveryone else around here makes\nme, Narcian, so SPITTING mad!\nThey refuse to bow down!
MID_NACIEN_HOME5: I, Narcian, have a weakness. If I pass\na mirror in battle, I'm so smitten with\nmy prowess that I cease battling.$k$pSo keep those mirrors OFF the\nbattlefield!

I am full of\nnothing BUT me!$k$pHow else would I have clawed my\nway to the top? Confidence is king,\nand I would be emperor!$k$pHmpf. You might be the first one\nto ever stand there and say\nsuch a thing to my face.$k$pI'll make you regret that you\npicked a fight with me, Narcian!\nOne day I'll make you kneel.$k$pThen I'll pet your head like a little\nkitty—and keep you at my side\nforever! Ha ha ha ha!
