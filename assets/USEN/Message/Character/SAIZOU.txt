MID_SAIZOU_HOME1: Prince Alfonse and Princess Sharena\naren't attended by bodyguards.\nOr so it seems...$k$pSurely, they must have a ninja or\ntwo in the shadows. But if so,\nI'm unable to detect any.
MID_SAIZOU_HOME2: I serve Lord Ryoma, the future King\nof Hoshido. I have long protected\nhim, no matter what the cost.
MID_SAIZOU_HOME3: I appreciate that you do your patrols.\nBut I don't respond well to being\nstared at. So don't.
MID_SAIZOU_HOME4: You need training. Same goes for\neveryone here. But you're crucial.\nAnd especially defenseless.
MID_SAIZOU_HOME5: I'm always watching over you from\nthe shadows. I've sensed you...\nsense me. Good.$k$pBut not good enough. You miss me\nmost of the time. If I were an enemy,\nyou'd be in your grave by now.
MID_SAIZOU_FRIEND: You there. I suspect that you are\n$Nu, hmm?$k$pThen my mission is nearly over.\nI bring you greetings from\n$Nf.
MID_SAIZOU_LEVEL1: I can take on anyone.
MID_SAIZOU_LEVEL2: Soon I will be worthy to serve\nmy liege.
MID_SAIZOU_LEVEL3: Unacceptable.
MID_SAIZOU_SKILL: Now I'm more worthy of being\nfifth in a line of Saizos.
MID_SAIZOU_JOIN: I am a Hoshidan ninja, fifth to bear the\nproud name of Saizo. I hope you've\ncalled me here with good reason.
MID_SAIZOU_STRONGEST: Hmpf. You always spot me now\nwhen I'm around. Not bad,\n$Nu.$k$pYou couldn't for a while, you know.\nI'd be standing right here, in front of\nyour face, and you'd be oblivious.$k$pYou, our great summoner, were\nwide open to attack from the\nshadows! Truly disturbing.$k$pAnd that's not all. I could follow\nyou for half the day without you\never noticing that I was there.$k$pOh, now before you run away with\nany foolish ideas, like maybe I\nwas watching out for you...$k$pI should set the matter straight—\nthat I was only monitoring\nour weak link.$k$pIf you get taken out, then I'll be put\nin danger. If I get taken out, then my\nlord, Ryoma, loses my protection.$k$pWhat I'm trying to say is since\nyou got better at taking care of\nyourself...$k$pI may be willing to watch out for\nyou from the shadows. A little.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE01: せいっ
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE02: でやっ
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE03: ぐあっ！
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE04: くそっ…！
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE05: You have breathed your last.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE06: Die.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE07: Saizo the Fifth strikes.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE08: Time for mayhem.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE09: I failed...
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE10: Hmmm.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE11: Sorry. Not the type to chat.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE12: Hmm... Is the Order of Heroes some form of royal castle guard?
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE13: I never get tired. So don't insult me with coffee or tea. Or candy. Never candy.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE14: You're our leader. So I will respect your authority. Doesn't mean I have to like it.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE15: Why the blazes was I brought here, of all places?
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE16: Is Lord Ryoma here? I do have a higher duty, you know.
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE17: I'll do everything you command. But only so I can get back home to Hoshido faster!
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE18: Yes?
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE19: What?
MID_SAIZOU_VOICE20: Hmph.
