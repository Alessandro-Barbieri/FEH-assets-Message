MID_LUTE_HOME1: You use magic? That makes you\ncompetition. At least, until we make it\nclear which of us is superior.
MID_LUTE_HOME2: My research in Renais was quite\nrewarding, but the magic of this world\nis rather fascinating as well.
MID_LUTE_HOME3: Your face indicates that battle has left\nyou weary. I once read about an herb\nthat can help alleviate that.$k$pIt was on page 339 of De Floris\nMysticis. Paragraph four. Sentence\nthree.
MID_LUTE_HOME4: Do you need something from me? My\ntask list currently includes 25 items\nacross seven categories.
MID_LUTE_HOME5: Today I will review chapter five of\nA Young Girl's Primer on Nazonian\nMagic. From memory.$k$pAfterward, I'll head out to collect some\nof the more interesting herbs that\ngrow in this world.
MID_LUTE_FRIEND: I memorized a message for you from\n$Nf, thus\neliminating the need to write it down.$k$pSuch a task was child's play for a\nmage and scholar without equal.
MID_LUTE_LEVEL1: Statistically speaking, good luck\nis just as likely as bad.
MID_LUTE_LEVEL2: Surprised? Don't be. There's no\none better than me!
MID_LUTE_LEVEL3: Statistically speaking, bad luck is\njust as likely as good.
MID_LUTE_SKILL: You've made a superior being\nfar more superior.
MID_LUTE_JOIN: I'm Lute, a mage of profound genius.\nIf it's ultimate battle power you wished\nfor, consider your wish granted.
MID_LUTE_STRONGEST: I've been examining you since the\nday you summoned me here. My\ndaily records are impeccable.$k$pThis journal is entitled\n$Nu: Daily\nObservations and Habits.$k$pYou'll be impressed to find I did not\nmiss a single day. Please examine it.$k$p"Morning: $Nu\nrose early and ate a hearty breakfast\nand then trained until lunchtime.$k$p"Noon: $Nu\nate a meager lunch and then\npatrolled the castle's perimeter.$k$p"Evening: $Nu\nate dinner, took a bath, and then\nretired to bed without dessert."$k$pQuite insightful and thorough, as you\ncan see. I review this journal nightly.$k$pAt first, I thought you may be a threat\nto my natural superiority, so I sought\nto discover your weaknesses.$k$pBut as I continued to study you, my\nmotives began to change. It was quite\nthe odd phenomenon.$k$pFurther observations are required for\nme to fully understand it, so I must\ncontinue my daily research.$k$pPlease go about your business as\nusual. I'll compile volume two of my\njournal from a distance, as before.
MID_LUTE_VOICE01: では。
MID_LUTE_VOICE02: 優秀ですから。
MID_LUTE_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_LUTE_VOICE04: 私は…まだ…
MID_LUTE_VOICE05: I am superior, after all.
MID_LUTE_VOICE06: I'll rip you to shreds with love!
MID_LUTE_VOICE07: You—you're dangerous.
MID_LUTE_VOICE08: Of course I'll win.
MID_LUTE_VOICE09: I don't want to die...
MID_LUTE_VOICE10: Heh. Heh. Heh.
MID_LUTE_VOICE11: I'm Lute, genius mage extraordinaire. You've probably heard of me.
MID_LUTE_VOICE12: My mood? On a scale of 1 to 48, I'd say I'm at a 14.
MID_LUTE_VOICE13: Your flesh shows no signs of putrefaction. It seems you're still alive.
MID_LUTE_VOICE14: You wish simply to chat? That sounds neither productive nor strategically valuable, but...
MID_LUTE_VOICE15: You may pose a threat to my natural superiority. This is troubling...
MID_LUTE_VOICE16: There is still much I need to study. My books so far have taught me nothing of love...
MID_LUTE_VOICE17: You and I should stick together for a while longer. After all, there's no one better than me...and you.
MID_LUTE_VOICE18: Yes?
MID_LUTE_VOICE19: You need me.
MID_LUTE_VOICE20: Let's begin.
