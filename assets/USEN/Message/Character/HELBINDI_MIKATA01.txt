MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_HOME1: This place is heaven compared to the\nfilth pile I come from. That's where I\nbelong, though.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_HOME2: I came from dirt—just another piece\nof filth with nothing. My strength is all\nI have.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_HOME3: You think you want to hear about\nwhy I fight, do you? Don't waste my\ntime with stupid questions.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_HOME4: Is that brat Ylgr here? ...No, forget it.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_HOME5: If a girl called Menja shows up... No,\nnever damn mind. Forget I said\nanything.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_FRIEND: You want to know what I'm doing\nhere? What makes you think you\ncan ask me questions?$k$pNot too bright, are you,\n$Nu...
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_LEVEL1: Power! If you get your hands on\nsome power, you can have it all!
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_LEVEL2: Ha! There it is!
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_LEVEL3: Damn it. Damn it all!
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_SKILL: Thanks. ...What? You got a\nproblem with gratitude?
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_JOIN: I'm Helbindi, a general from Múspell.\nThis is a joke, right? The only place\nI'm headed is hell.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_STRONGEST: Here it comes. You want to know\nwhy I follow you, right?\nStupid question.$k$pIt's not like it's easy for me, either.\nI've put plenty of people just like you\nin the ground.$k$pIt's simple. Even a beast will wag his\ntail and show his belly when\nsomebody strong shows up.$k$pSurtr could have killed me, no\nproblem. You, though... I'm more\nafraid of what you can do.$k$pI don't mean your trick of summoning\nwarriors. There's just something\nabout you...I can't put my finger on.$k$pI've got this feeling that some day\nyou're going to...do something.$k$pJust so we're clear, I'm not your pal,\nand I'm not your pet. You're strong,\nso I follow you.$k$pDon't you forget it.

MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_VOICE14: Why do I fight? Does it matter? No. It doesn't.
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_VOICE15: Why're you spending time with filth like me?
MID_HELBINDI_MIKATA01_VOICE16: Money. If I had money, I... I could do what I need to do.
