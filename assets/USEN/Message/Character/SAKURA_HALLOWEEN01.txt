It's one\nof the seven wonders of the castle.$k$pWhy are you making that face? Are\nyou scared? I'm so sorry!$k$pBut don't worry! As long as I'm here\nwith you, you have nothing to fear.

MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE10: Heehee...
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE11: Um, let's see.... Give me a treat or...I'll play a trick on you?
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE12: I'm dressed as a Hoshidan cat spirit that we call a nekomata.
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE13: Ahem. Meow. Do you think that would pass as cat?
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE14: Please don't scratch me behind the ears. It is just a costume, you know.
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE15: I am fond of the harvest festival. So much candy, you see.
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE16: Being dressed as a cat spirit... I don't think I'd be scared by ghost stories or dark rooms. At least, I hope not.
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE17: Ha! Look what the cat dragged in... A rice-dumpling treat for us to share!
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE18: All right.
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE19: Candy...
MID_SAKURA_HALLOWEEN01_VOICE20: Not scared.
