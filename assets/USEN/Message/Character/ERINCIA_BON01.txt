MID_ERINCIA_BON01_HOME1: This yukata is so easy to move in, not\nto mention nice and cool. But...$k$pDo you happen to know if I'm\nwearing it properly?
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_HOME2: One day, I hope to hold a festival just\nlike this in Crimea. One that will bring\neveryone together in joy.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_HOME3: What is it that starts war? Perhaps it\nall stems from a fear of different\ncultures or ways of thinking...
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_HOME4: I've never danced a foreign dance\nbefore. Its moves are so unique. But\nI'm still not quite getting them right...$k$pWould you mind practicing with me?
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_HOME5: My father was troubled endlessly by\nhow baseless assumptions can lead\nto discrimination against other lands.$k$pI'm certain there is a role I can play to\nend such atrocities as well...
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_FRIEND: I come with an invitation to the\nsummer festival from my lord\n$Nf.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_LEVEL1: It seems my training has borne\nfruit. I feel so accomplished!
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_LEVEL2: I think I'm finally getting used to\nthis dance's motions.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_LEVEL3: Perhaps I'm still too self-\nconscious about this dance...
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_SKILL: Thank you for this. I'll do all I can\nto help you.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_JOIN: I am Elincia, daughter of King Ramon\nof Crimea. Hm? My outfit comes as a\nsurprise to you?$k$pThis is actually sacred garb for a\nfestival.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_STRONGEST: Have you taken time to look upon the\nsmiling faces of those participating in\nthe summer festival?$k$pWhat we should fight to protect is not\nhistory or kingdoms but those smiling\ncitizens.$k$pTaking part in this festival, having the\nchance to dance with everyone, has\nreaffirmed my resolve to fight.$k$pI know not what storms may come in\nthe future, but I'll never hesitate to\nraise my weapon for my people.$k$pOnce peace has been restored, let's\ndance together again. Hand in hand,\nmy lord $Nu.

MID_ERINCIA_BON01_VOICE13: A-one, A-two... Wh-whoa, eek! Oh, I'm so sorry. I tripped over my own feet. This dance is not as easy as it looks...
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_VOICE14: I have never been a particularly skilled dancer, so I must practice often to make up for that.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_VOICE15: This outfit was a gift... It's a symbol of Hoshido's friendship.
MID_ERINCIA_BON01_VOICE16: If you strive to learn all you can about another kingdom, you are sure to find common ground.
