MID_ARUM_HOME1: This place has so many things I've\nnever seen before and all kinds of\npeople I never thought I'd meet.$k$pAmazing, really, and sort of\nintimidating.
MID_ARUM_HOME2: The Deliverance fights to free Zofia\nfrom Chancellor Desaix. A hard battle,\nand who knows when it will end?
MID_ARUM_HOME3: Checking in on everyone? Sure you\nare. I need to do it too as leader\nof the Deliverance.
MID_ARUM_HOME4: Mind telling me your story? I don't\nknow much about much, so you'll\nfind me a ready listener.
MID_ARUM_HOME5: I was training with my sword, but\nmostly because if I don't, I hear my\ngrandfather's voice in my head.$k$pHe's Sir Mycen—and someone you\ndon't want to disappoint. So I always\nstay on top of my training.
MID_ARUM_FRIEND: So this is another version of the\nAskran Kingdom...$k$pOh, hello there. Someone sent me\nhere to say that. It was your friend\n$Nf.
MID_ARUM_LEVEL1: I can really feel the strength\nrising up inside of me!
MID_ARUM_LEVEL2: I'll be more helpful to you with\nmore strength like this.
MID_ARUM_LEVEL3: Sorry about that. I'm not doing\nall that well, $Nu.
MID_ARUM_SKILL: You did that for me? I promise to\nfight as hard as I can!
MID_ARUM_JOIN: I'm Alm, leader of the Deliverance.\nYou can count on me to take up\nmy sword for your cause.
MID_ARUM_STRONGEST: Good timing. I've been meaning to\ntalk to you about something,\n$Nu.$k$pMy grandfather refused to let me\never leave my home, Ram\nVillage.$k$pSo I don't know much about\nthe world.$k$pSince you summoned me here, I've\nmet many different people. So\nmany...surprises.$k$pWhen it comes to you, I feel a bond\ndifferent than the one I have with\nmy friends.$k$pI'm...relieved? Or...at ease? Really,\nI've only felt this way with one\nother person.$k$pIt's more than just you showing me\nall of these new things—much\nbigger than that, really.$k$pThis might sound sappy, but I'll say\nit anyway. Meeting you was like the\ndawn of something new. Thanks.

MID_ARUM_VOICE13: I have a lot of learning to do when it comes to...everything.
MID_ARUM_VOICE14: My friends? Good people. And fun.
MID_ARUM_VOICE15: There's nothing harder than the training my grandfather put me through. No way.
