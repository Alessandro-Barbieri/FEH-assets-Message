MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_HOME1: What do I want out of my marriage?\nIt's simple. I'd be happiest knowing\nmy husband is safe and sound.
MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_HOME2: Tell me. Do you believe in love? Do\nyou have someone special out there,\n$Nu?
MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_HOME3: I've heard that the secret to a happy\nmarriage is consideration. Always\nshow your partner that you care.
MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_HOME4: I have some experience fighting\ninfantry battles without my pegasus.\nNot dressed like this, of course...
MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_HOME5: This dress fits me perfectly.\nSomehow...I can't help but smile\nwhile wearing it.
MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_FRIEND: Hello! I bring wishes for your health\nand happiness, sent warmly\nby $Nf.
MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_LEVEL1: Do you think I'll make a good\nmatch?

MID_SHEEDA_BRIDE01_STRONGEST: What does love mean to you?\nTell me, $Nu.$k$pAs long as the person I love is safe\nand happy... That's really all that\nmatters to me.$k$pWearing this dress got me thinking,\nthough. When they wed, two people\nvow to make each other happy.$k$pIf I were to die... I'm sure that the\nperson I love would be sad. I\nwonder... Is that what love is?$k$pLove isn't as simple as it seems. And\nI'm sure we all feel it differently...$k$pWhat does love mean to you?\nPlease, if you would, share your\nthoughts with me.
