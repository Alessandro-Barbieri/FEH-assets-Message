MID_SHIGURE_HOME1: So many people from so many worlds\ngather here... Tell me: What is the\nscenery like where you're from?
MID_SHIGURE_HOME2: I was raised in the Deeprealms, but\nall my friends, and all those who\ncared for me...$k$pThey all lost their lives when the\nenemy struck.
MID_SHIGURE_HOME3: Instead of walking your patrol route,\nwould you rather join me for a ride on\nmy pegasus?$k$pThink of it as...a stroll through the sky.\nBesides, the wind up there is quite\nrefreshing.
MID_SHIGURE_HOME4: Care to accompany me on a small\nscenic tour? I want to remember\nevery detail about this world.
MID_SHIGURE_HOME5: I was just drawing a picture. I think I\nlanded upon a fitting theme. It's a\ngreat hero from another world...
MID_SHIGURE_FRIEND: I flew here to say hello and to let you\nknow that $Nf\nis thinking well of you.
MID_SHIGURE_LEVEL1: So this is what it's like on cloud\nnine!
MID_SHIGURE_LEVEL2: This calls for a song.\nAaaand a 1, 2, 3...
MID_SHIGURE_LEVEL3: That was not my best\nperformance...
MID_SHIGURE_SKILL: What beautiful power...\nThank you.
MID_SHIGURE_JOIN: It's good to meet you. I'm Shigure,\nAzura's son.$k$pI may be a skilled singer, but on the\nbattlefield I'll assist you with my lance\nfrom atop my pegasus.
MID_SHIGURE_STRONGEST: I'm glad you've come to see me. Do\nyou want my company on a mission?\nOr perhaps to just look for a rainbow.$k$pI do enjoy being by myself, but\nspending time with you is also quite\nrelaxing. Perhaps it's because...$k$pYou're not the chatty type.$k$pI have grown fond of you. I hope you'll\nremember me even after we one day\npart ways.$k$pNothing would make me happier than\nif every time you glance at the sky or\nhear a song, you think of me.$k$pPerhaps it's a bit selfish for a mere\nHero to ask for such a thing from a\nSummoner, but it's simply how I feel.$k$pAnd I thought you should know.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE01: はいっ

MID_SHIGURE_VOICE09: The sky, so beautiful...
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE10: Heehee...
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE11: You are the ocean's gray waves...
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE12: Please...never forget me.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE13: When I gaze at the majesty of the open sky, I feel so free. Don't you?
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE14: I'm not as skilled as my mother, but I do enjoy singing.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE15: The scenery here is so beautiful... I want to pick up my paintbrush again. It's inspirational.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE16: Tell me. When I leave here, will thousands of years have passed in my own world?
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE17: Would you walk with me sometime? You could tell me more about this beautiful world and about yourself as well.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE18: All right.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE19: I'm Shigure.
MID_SHIGURE_VOICE20: Shall we go?
