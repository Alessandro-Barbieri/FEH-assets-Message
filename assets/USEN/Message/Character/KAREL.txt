MID_KAREL_HOME1: The most skillful Heroes from\nall the worlds gather in this one?\nWhat a lovely, lovely place.
MID_KAREL_HOME2: I have taken up my family's\nblade, which means that I am\nnow one with my weapon.
MID_KAREL_HOME3: Point me at the strongest of this\nworld. My blade longs to feast\non worthy meat.
MID_KAREL_HOME4: Approaching me? Here? I may take\nthat as a challenge someday.\nBest you learn to defend yourself.
MID_KAREL_HOME5: I am practicing a sword technique\nthat we have kept secret within\nour family—to the extreme.$k$pSo, I'll do you the favor of telling\nyou to walk away. Unless, of\ncourse, you wish to see it?
MID_KAREL_FRIEND: You must be $Nu.$k$pSo, you think yourself a friend of\n$Nf? Heh.
MID_KAREL_LEVEL1: I pile my victims to the sky so\nthe gods bless my blade!
MID_KAREL_LEVEL2: My body and my blade must\nget faster and fiercer!
MID_KAREL_LEVEL3: This risks tarnishing my\nblade—my body!
MID_KAREL_SKILL: Lovely, lovely—I yearn to unleash\nmy blade!
MID_KAREL_JOIN: I am Karel. Care to meet my blade?\nOh, let me withdraw the offer.\nYou are not ready...yet.
MID_KAREL_STRONGEST: You are a puzzle to me. I am on\nthe path of the sword and cut down\nthose strong enough to matter.$k$pYet you cannot fight—not with a\nsword, not even any magic.\nStill, you are on my path.$k$pHow troubling. Why don't I just walk\naround you? Why do I continue\nto fight for you? Perhaps...$k$pPerhaps it is because having\nyou at my side propels me\nfaster along my path!$k$pIn any case, here we are—the\nsword and the swordless!$k$pWhat else can I do but continue?\nThat is, until the day when I see\nyou standing IN my way.

MID_KAREL_VOICE12: My blade comes out at the...slightest provocation.
MID_KAREL_VOICE13: I was raised to live and die by the sword. Now, among my family members, I live. My sister does too.
MID_KAREL_VOICE14: Only one can wield the sword.
MID_KAREL_VOICE15: My body? My blade? We are one and the same.
MID_KAREL_VOICE16: I am on the path of the sword. I seek its end—one way or another.
