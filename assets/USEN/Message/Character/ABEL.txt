MID_ABEL_HOME1: I once betrayed Prince Marth, if\nonly because Est was a hostage.\nI will never atone for that crime.
MID_ABEL_HOME2: I own a small shop in Altea. If you\never have need of goods, you have\nbut to ask.
MID_ABEL_HOME3: Here, take this torch with you for\npatrols. It should make it a little\neasier to find your way in the dark.
MID_ABEL_HOME4: I'm curious about the shops in\ntown. Would you join me to visit\nthem sometime?
MID_ABEL_HOME5: My Est prepares the most\nwonderful dishes. If only you\ncould try them!
MID_ABEL_FRIEND: You're $Nu, yes?$k$pI've been sent to deliver greetings\nfrom $Nf!
MID_ABEL_LEVEL1: For my homeland and for my\nbeloved.
MID_ABEL_LEVEL2: I'm pleased that I haven't gotten\ntoo rusty.
MID_ABEL_LEVEL3: Drat. I've neglected my training...
MID_ABEL_SKILL: Thank you. I will always be a\nproud knight of Altea.
MID_ABEL_JOIN: I am Abel, a knight of Altea—or\nformer knight, anyway. These\ndays, I am but a shopkeeper.
MID_ABEL_STRONGEST: Prince Marth and my beloved Est\nare both so important to me.$k$pMy loyalty toward my liege,\nmy affection toward my beloved...\nBoth feelings are clear and strong.$k$pBut are my feelings toward you\nloyalty because you summoned me?\nOr genuine, growing friendship?$k$pI cannot say. The only thing that is\nclear...is that now I have someone\nelse who is important to me.$k$pI hope you will continue to count\non me as you always have.

MID_ABEL_VOICE10: Haha
MID_ABEL_VOICE11: What's wrong?
MID_ABEL_VOICE12: I fear that I've grown soft since leaving the knights.
MID_ABEL_VOICE13: I run a small shop. Perhaps you can visit someday.
MID_ABEL_VOICE14: Let me know if you need anything—anything at all.
MID_ABEL_VOICE15: I was once known as...Abel the Panther.
MID_ABEL_VOICE16: When there are two precious things in your life, you must choose between them.
MID_ABEL_VOICE17: I swear on my life never to betray you.
MID_ABEL_VOICE18: Of course.

MID_ABEL_VOICE20: Yes.
