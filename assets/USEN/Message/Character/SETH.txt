MID_SETH_HOME1: Prince Alfonse is far too kind. Yes,\nkindness is a virtue. But sometimes...$k$pNo, forgive me. It is not my place to\nspeak.
MID_SETH_HOME2: I serve the royal family of Renais. All\nI want is to protect  Prince Ephraim\nand Princess Eirika.
MID_SETH_HOME3: There must be some tasks you can\ndelegate to me. You must reserve\nyour strength for where it is needed.$k$pThis is not simply for your benefit.\nIt is for the sake of the entire army.
MID_SETH_HOME4: Do not trouble yourself over my well-\nbeing. I would play the pawn gladly,\nwould it bring us victory.
MID_SETH_HOME5: I spent the day in training. That has\nbeen my habit ever since I was a\nyoung squire.
MID_SETH_FRIEND: Pardon me. I was entrusted with the\ntask of bringing you a greeting by\n$Nf.
MID_SETH_LEVEL1: Now is not the time to rest. I must\nset my sights on a loftier peak.
MID_SETH_LEVEL2: Further training is required—that\nmuch is sure.
MID_SETH_LEVEL3: I'll just have to step up my training\nto compensate for this.
MID_SETH_SKILL: You'll see my gratitude in each\nand every swing of my sword.
MID_SETH_JOIN: I am Seth, a knight of Renais. I must\nbeg your pardon, but...are Princess\nEirika and Prince Ephraim here?
MID_SETH_STRONGEST: I must express my gratitude for\nyour leadership. As a knight, all I ask\nfor is an opportunity to serve.$k$pHowever, permit me to say just one\nthing.$k$pFeelings have no place on the\nbattlefield. You issue orders. I obey\nthem. That is all.$k$pIn battle, a life-or-death moment could\ncome at any time. Emotions could\ncloud your judgment.$k$pIf my mind was on you instead of\nthe opponent before me, that could\nend up costing us a victory.$k$pSo I must ask that you keep your\ndistance. This will ensure that I can\ncontinue to protect you in the future.
