MID_HINOKA2_HOME1: I've spent my life training to be a\nwarrior so I never had time to learn\ndomestic skills like cooking or sewing.$k$pBut learning a less warlike skill may\nhelp broaden my horizons... What do\nyou think?
MID_HINOKA2_HOME2: Kinshi are legendary giant birds,\nnative to my homeland.$k$pI'd love to someday take you to\nHoshido so we can watch them soar\nacross the skies together.
MID_HINOKA2_HOME3: I know you've got plenty of\nexperience with all sorts of Heroes,\nbut let me give you some advice...$k$pWhen it comes to choosing a retainer,\ndo your research! Otherwise, you may\nbe in for a rude awakening...
MID_HINOKA2_HOME4: I'm gonna get myself pumped up for\nthe next fight with a short jog. Wanna\ncome with?
MID_HINOKA2_HOME5: When it comes to taking down a flying\ntarget, nothing beats a bow. But using\none requires the proper technique.$k$pSo I don't slack off when it comes to\ntraining. I'm out there each and every\nday!
MID_HINOKA2_FRIEND: Am I...in the right place? Is\n$Nu here?$k$pPerfect! I bring greetings from\n$Nf!
MID_HINOKA2_LEVEL1: I feel the power surging through\nme. OK, Hinoka, you can do this!
MID_HINOKA2_LEVEL2: All right! Let's keep on training!
MID_HINOKA2_LEVEL3: Maybe my head was too in the\nclouds...
MID_HINOKA2_SKILL: Now I'm even better prepared for\nbattle! Let's get out there!
MID_HINOKA2_JOIN: I'm Hinoka, a princess of Hoshido. If\nyou need my help to win a fight, just\ncall on me and my bow!$k$pWe'll pierce through your enemies,\nrows at a time!
MID_HINOKA2_STRONGEST: You sure put in a hard day's work in\nthat last battle. I've gotta say, it's\nimpressive watching you out there!$k$pHeh, my fighting was worthy of a\nwarrior princess? Aw, shucks. Thanks\nfor saying! Although...$k$pI wasn't always a warrior like I am\nnow. When I was younger, I was\nmore like a typical little girl.$k$pBut then, something...happened...\nAnd afterward, I decided I would learn\nhow to fight.$k$pEver since, I've been training to hone\nmy battle skills. And I'm glad I did, too!$k$pOtherwise, I'd have never been\nsummoned here, and I'd never have\nthe chance to fight by your side.$k$pHeh, I should be sending a thank-you\nnote to my past self.$k$pUmm... Well, that was all a little\nembarrassing to say out loud, so I'm\ngonna go for a stroll in the sky.$k$pAnd you're coming with!
