MID_ANNA_HOME1: Alfonse was once friends with a great\nHero. But when Alfonse lost his friend\nin battle, he was never the same.
MID_ANNA_HOME2: We can revive Heroes who fall\nduring battle as long as you're\nwith us, Summoner.$k$pStill, though this reverses the\nravages of the battlefield,\nthey feel pain—just as we do.
MID_ANNA_HOME3: Checking up on everyone? Thank\nyou. That's helpful. Let me know\nif you spot anything unusual!
MID_ANNA_HOME4: How about we get some practice in?\nThat'd make you a stronger member\nof our group—summoning and all!
MID_ANNA_HOME5: Good timing. I made some official\nmerchandise for the Order of Heroes.\nThink they'll sell?
MID_ANNA_FRIEND: Looks like your group is strong. I'd\nbetter keep building mine. Oh, hello\nfrom $Nf!
MID_ANNA_LEVEL1: I'm going to push myself even\nharder now!
MID_ANNA_LEVEL2: Good! But as commander, I must\nkeep striving for more.
MID_ANNA_LEVEL3: I expect much more of myself\nthan that!
MID_ANNA_SKILL: Thanks for helping me get stronger.\nI swear to make it worth your trouble.
MID_ANNA_STRONGEST: I have an assessment to make.\nYou've become more dependable\nthan I ever imagined.$k$pFrankly, I wasn't certain about you\nfrom the start. You were new to\nus. We were new to you.$k$pBut look at you now—a great\ntactician, giving us directions that\nare often excellent!$k$pRemember when you first showed up\nand I said you didn't look like the\nGreat Hero from our legend?$k$pI'm sorry about all of that. As the\ncommander here, I should know to\nnever judge a book by its cover.$k$pThe person who was once my\nsuperior drilled that into my head.\nSo, I should have known better.$k$pYou are the Great Hero, and you\nhave lived up to the legend!$k$pStill, you're also part of my Order of\nHeroes, so don't expect any\npreferential treatment.$k$pBut until the day comes when we\nsave this kingdom once and for all,\nyou and I are in this...together.
