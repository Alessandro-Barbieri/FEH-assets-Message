MID_CELLICA_HOME1: The Askran Kingdom is so beautiful.\nIt saddens me to hear that it is also\nengulfed in conflict.
MID_CELLICA_HOME2: I trained as a priestess at a priory.\nAnd before that, I lived in Ram, a\nsmall village...$k$pBut even further back, I lived in a\ncastle. Keep that between us, OK?
MID_CELLICA_HOME3: If you get tired, please let me know. I'll\npour you some hot tea, and we'll take\na break together.
MID_CELLICA_HOME4: I'm going to offer a prayer to Mila.\nWould you care to join me? I think\nyou'll find it calming. I know I do.
MID_CELLICA_HOME5: I was thinking about a childhood\nfriend of mine. For some reason, we\ncan never quite seem to meet up...$k$pIs it fate that keeps us apart?
MID_CELLICA_FRIEND: Are you $Nu?\nI was asked to bring you a message\nfrom $Nf.
MID_CELLICA_LEVEL1: I have the strength to fight, too!
MID_CELLICA_LEVEL2: Hard work does bring results.
MID_CELLICA_LEVEL3: Oh... What a disappointment.
MID_CELLICA_SKILL: This strength that you've given me\nwill not go to waste.
MID_CELLICA_JOIN: I am Celica, a priestess. Though I'd\nrather avoid bloodshed, I am\nprepared to fight if I must.
MID_CELLICA_STRONGEST: There's something I'd like to speak to\nyou about. Will you listen to what I\nhave to say?$k$pAs you know, people call me Celica.\nBut, actually...I have another name.\nMy true name is Anthiese.$k$pThis is a secret I must guard closely.\nIf the people of Zofia were to learn of\nit, it would result in a pointless war.$k$pI do feel safe telling you, though. In\nfact, I want you to understand. You\nmatter to me. I trust you with my life.$k$pEven if I return to my world, please\nremember the time we spent. Think of\nme... $k$pThe girl called both Celica...and\nAnthiese.\n
