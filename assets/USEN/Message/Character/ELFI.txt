MID_ELFI_VOICE11: Takes a lot of bricks to make this wall. That means training, food, and lots of both.
MID_ELFI_VOICE12: One, two, three—! Heh. Always training. Always counting.
MID_ELFI_VOICE13: Fish or fowl? Either one's just fine. Long as I get a pile on my plate.
MID_ELFI_VOICE14: Need any boulders moved? No problem for me.
MID_ELFI_VOICE15: Quite a weapon you've got there. Afraid I'd break it if I touched it.
MID_ELFI_VOICE16: Where's Lady Elise? She and I like to grab snacks when we can.
MID_ELFI_VOICE17: You leave the heavy stuff to me. I'd lift a cow for you, friend.
