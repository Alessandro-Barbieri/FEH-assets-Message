MID_CHROM_SPRING01_HOME1: Anna wants to master painting eggs\nfor the spring festival. No doubt\nshe wants to sell them.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_HOME2: We were right in the middle of\ncelebrating the arrival of spring\nwhen I was summoned.$k$pHad I known I would be plucked\nfrom our castle like that, I would\nhave come...better prepared.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_HOME3: On patrol, $Nu?$k$pI know that this time of year can put\na spring in our steps. Just remember\nthat if you get tired, I'll take my turn.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_HOME4: We have a custom of painting eggs\nduring our spring festival. But I have\na habit of crushing the eggs I make.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_HOME5: I have to take special care with my,\ner, weapon here. It chips easily.\nHmm...I miss Falchion.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_FRIEND: Greetings from $Nf.$k$pDo you enjoy the spring season,\n$Nu? I do!
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_LEVEL1: Ha! The spirit of spring moves\nthrough me.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_LEVEL2: In the spirit of spring, I will\ngrow stronger!
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_LEVEL3: I'm not living up to the whole\nidea of spring growth here.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_SKILL: Whatever you did there is making\nthis costume fit me better!
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_JOIN: I'm Chrom, Prince of the Halidom of\nYlisse. Enjoying the spring festival?\nI've dressed for the occasion!
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_STRONGEST: Ah, if it isn't $Nu!$k$pI just finished painting some\nspring-festival eggs. Not bad, if\nI say so myself. Take a look.$k$pWhat? Curious what all that\nlettering is? It's written in the\nlanguage of Ylisse.$k$pIt's a bit of a poem, I guess, that\nsays how much I value your\npresence here.$k$pAnd see? On this side, I've painted\na picture of you. Good likeness,\ndon't you think?$k$pWhat, it isn't? Well, I tried, and at\nleast now you know that I truly\ndo value our strong bond.$k$pNow, may we spend many spring\nfestivals together and...I promise\nto work on my painting skills.

MID_CHROM_SPRING01_VOICE13: Those in my group, the Shepherds, tell me to wear more dashing outfits. This dashing enough?
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_VOICE14: Eggs and rabbits have been symbols of the spring festival for ages.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_VOICE15: I heard my sister Lissa hid eggs all over Ylisse. What a quest I'll have in store when I go home.
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_VOICE16: I'll stand out in battle going out dressed like this!
MID_CHROM_SPRING01_VOICE17: That we met in the spring must be important. I hope it means our bond will grow ever stronger.
