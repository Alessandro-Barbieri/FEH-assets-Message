MID_CLERBE_HOME1: Royalty, fighting on the front lines? A\nruler must risk everything, it seems.\nIn Zofia, we forgot that long ago...
MID_CLERBE_HOME2: I fight as part of the Deliverance. We\nwill take back Zofia from Desaix's\nunjust rule—no matter what.
MID_CLERBE_HOME3: I see your consideration for your\ncomrades. You are kind and diligent\nin your duties. May I rely on you, too?
MID_CLERBE_HOME4: I'd love to learn more about this world.\nYour perspective would be of\nparticular value—if you have the time.
MID_CLERBE_HOME5: I was just taking care of my horse.\nWith no attendants here, the task falls\nto me. It's a lot of work, but I enjoy it.
MID_CLERBE_FRIEND: Ah, $Nu, is it?$k$pI bring with me the faith and respect\nof $Nf.
MID_CLERBE_LEVEL1: This power propels us to the\nrealization of our ideals!
MID_CLERBE_LEVEL2: I must continue to devote myself\nto training...
MID_CLERBE_LEVEL3: You have my apologies. I have\nfailed to meet your expectations.
MID_CLERBE_SKILL: I shall take this power and deliver\nvictory to you!
MID_CLERBE_JOIN: I am Clive. I believe that we of noble\nbirth have a duty to use our strength\nto bring peace to the land.
MID_CLERBE_STRONGEST: It's strange. As soon as I see you, I\nfeel the tension that has built up\nwithin me crumble into nothing.$k$pAs a knight commander, I always\nstrive to embody the qualities of a\nleader. It is my station.$k$pBetween us, however...I'll admit that I\nhave sometimes thought about\ncasting all of it away.$k$pI have never spoken to anyone about\nthis, you must understand.$k$pYou...are someone I can confide in.\nI feel I can tell you just about\nanything. Why is this?$k$pPerhaps it is because we hail from\ndifferent worlds, and different walks\nof life...$k$pThough that may be true...that is not\nthe whole truth.$k$pIt's your charisma. You charm us all...\nAnd we follow you, both on and off\nthe battlefield. That's how I see it.
