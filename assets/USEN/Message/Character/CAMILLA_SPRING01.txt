MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_HOME1: Princess Sharena really catches my\neye. That girl is as adorable as\nshe is formidable.$k$pI'd love to dress her up in a\nspring-festival outfit!
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_HOME2: The realm outside my family's castle\nis very dark. So every spring, we\ngo all out to decorate our home.$k$pFlowers of all colors...bunnies of\nall shapes and sizes...and more\neggs than you can imagine!
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_HOME3: The spring festival always reminds\nme to live a life of sweet ease,\n$Nu.$k$pDo remember that you can lay\nyour weary head in my lap.
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_HOME4: Care to dress up in one of these\nfestival outfits? It'd really suit you.\nOh, yes. Just too cute!
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_HOME5: I adore strolling around here in\nthe spring. It's simply ideal—so\nmany flowers!
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_FRIEND: I've come with spring greetings...and\nwith jealousy for how close you are\nwith $Nf.
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_LEVEL1: How glorious! I could jump for\njoy!
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_LEVEL2: Festival or not, I just can't help\ngrowing by leaps and bounds!
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_LEVEL3: Oh my... Is this outfit holding me\nback in some way?
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_SKILL: How sweet of you. Building me up\nfor summer, perhaps?
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_JOIN: I'm Camilla, eldest princess of Nohr,\ncome dressed for the spring fest. But\nit's rather tight, don't you think?
MID_CAMILLA_SPRING01_STRONGEST: Did you want to celebrate the\nspring festival with me today,\n$Nu?$k$pDelighted to oblige. Shall I pop\nsome rabbit ears on your head?\nRest your head in my lap?$k$pNo one relaxes better than I do.\nBack in my world, we lounge all day\nin public baths. Or at least I do.$k$pOh, wouldn't it just be the icing on\nthe cake to luxuriate in such\nsteaming-hot water right now?$k$pHmm? That has nothing to do\nwith this festival? Well, leave it\nto you to stay on task.$k$pGreat Hero of another world, you\nhave outmaneuvered me. I was\nhoping we'd get a holiday together.$k$pI love to get away from it all with\nmembers of my family—and I do\nconsider you family.$k$pThat means I'll also protect you as\nI would a brother or sister, even if\nyou are my superior here.$k$pStill, if you ever grow weary and\nneed to get some sleep, remember\nmy lap is forever yours.
