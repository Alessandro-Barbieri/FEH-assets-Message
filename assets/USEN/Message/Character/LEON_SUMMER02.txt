MID_LEON_SUMMER02_HOME1: Prince Alfonse loaned me a robe to\nward off the sun. But I'm embarrassed\nto admit...$k$pIt took me the better part of a day to\nrealize I had put it on inside out.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_HOME2: I won a battle and the prize was a trip\nto a tropical island. I wasn't interested,\nbut my retainers earned a vacation.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_HOME3: Is the heat getting to you? A freshly\nsqueezed glass of tomato juice will\nhelp with that.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_HOME4: I'd like to see Askran beaches after\nthe sun has set. The nighttime sea is\nlike a blanket of darkness.$k$pIt's a rather beautiful sight. Don't you\nagree?
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_HOME5: Me? I was reading treatises on\nbotany—summer vegetation\nspecifically.$k$pIt seems there are many varieties\nof tomato plants in other lands...\n
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_FRIEND: Fine greetings from\n$Nf. I'm glad\nI can wait indoors.$k$pIf left outside, I might start to tan.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_LEVEL1: Such results despite this outfit?\nMaybe it's not so bad after all.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_LEVEL2: Pretty impressive for fighting in a\nswimsuit, don't you think?\n
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_LEVEL3: If you are disappointed by these\nresults, then give me clothes.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_SKILL: Thanks for the extra power. But I\nwould rather have extra clothes.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_JOIN: I'm Leo, Prince of Nohr. And you\npulled me off a tropical island. Do you\nexpect me to fight in this outfit?
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_STRONGEST: You seem to be holding up well,\ndespite the heat. You're always\nwearing that hooded robe...$k$pAre you trying to avoid the sun as\nwell?$k$pThe sun can burn me in an instant so\nI avoid it at all costs. I'd rather not be\ncolored red from head to toe.$k$p...I beg your pardon? You say I'd look\nlike a tomato if that happened?\nHow in the world do you...$k$pCome up with such amazing ideas?!\nHow could I possibly hate looking like\nsomething I so cherish?$k$pMaybe I'll go get some sun right now.$k$pYou think...that's a bad idea? Well, if\nthat's your advice, I'll take it. But you\nhave given me food for thought.

MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE10: Heh
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE11: Tanlines. What torture!
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE12: Hot beaches? Hate them.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE13: Tropical islands? Forget it. And this swimsuit! Don't even get me started!
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE14: I actually like walking a beach at night. But swim? In the ocean? With my body?
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE15: Now, tomato juice, that I like. There's nothing more refreshing.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE16: I guess I should get some gifts for my retainers.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE17: Hey, if you like tropical islands, that's fine. Maybe it's not as bad as I say.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE18: OK.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE19: Tans...
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE20: So...hot.
MID_LEON_SUMMER02_VOICE21: What?! I can't wear this! It's disgraceful!
