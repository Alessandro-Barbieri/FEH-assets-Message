MID_RACKESIS_HOME1: Though not quite as fine a man as\nEldigan, my brother, Alfonse has\nrecommendable qualities.$k$pNo doubt, the prince will one day\nhelp Askr become a truly\ngreat realm.
MID_RACKESIS_HOME2: My brother set a high standard for\nwhat is possible in a man. How could\none ever marry, knowing him?
MID_RACKESIS_HOME3: You mustn't ever perish. I have\nsuffered far too much loss as it is.\nI would wither away.
MID_RACKESIS_HOME4: One wonders—if you served a\nfoolish ruler, would you obey\nwithout question or defy his will?
MID_RACKESIS_HOME5: My brother Eldigan possessed\nMystletainn, the Demon Sword, a\nlegendary blade in my world.$k$pHe was also known as a lord of\nlionhearted courage. I'll never meet\nthe likes of Eldigan again.
MID_RACKESIS_FRIEND: How do you do? Oh, on second\nglance, let me answer that. You're\ndoing surprisingly well here.
MID_RACKESIS_LEVEL1: Simply splendid, isn't it?
MID_RACKESIS_LEVEL2: No less than one expected.\nAnd yet, no more either.
MID_RACKESIS_LEVEL3: One isn't used to such\ndisappointments.
MID_RACKESIS_SKILL: One can only hope to be as\ntalented as her brother in time.
MID_RACKESIS_JOIN: One wonders—who are you? Not to\nmention, what are your intentions?\nAnd what is this curious place?
MID_RACKESIS_STRONGEST: In my world, my dear brother gave all,\nstruggling to serve the highest of\nknightly ideals.$k$pHow I tried to keep him from being\nconsumed by his situation.\nTried—and failed.$k$pMy heart has been torn to ribbons,\nand those ribbons, to tatters.$k$pDearest, darling Eldie—I mean,\nBrother—how I miss you and\nyour noble bearing.$k$pThough one longs to walk through\nlife with as superlative a person,\none must carry on.$k$pYou have proven that you, like he,\nfight to preserve the hope of\nothers who depend on you.$k$pOne hopes—that is, I hope—that you\nwill take great care and let me battle\nwith you. I can't stand any more loss.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE01: はっ
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE02: えいっ
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE04: No...
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE05: Sincere apologies.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE06: Not one step closer.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE07: You swine.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE08: Cease this nonsense.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE09: Eldigan...
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE10: Huhu
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE11: Quite all right?
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE12: Take care.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE13: Shall we converse? Perhaps over tea.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE14: Oh! My word, these brushes with others.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE15: When one's brother sets the standard, all men fall short of the mark.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE16: Eldie, my Eldie... Why?
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE17: I beg of you—don't stray from my side.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE18: Of course.
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE19: Really?
MID_RACKESIS_VOICE20: Onward.
