MID_MARTH_F_HOME1: Tell me again—this is not Ylisse? Did\nNaga make a mistake? Ah, no!\nForget I said anything.
MID_MARTH_F_HOME2: War consumed my world. Those who\nsurvived fought so valiantly... But\naverting the apocalypse falls to me.
MID_MARTH_F_HOME3: So you check on all of your troops?\nI understand how you feel. It hurts to\nlose them.
MID_MARTH_F_HOME4: It looks like Prince Alfonse is a skilled\nswordsman. I'd like to spar with him...\nYou'll arrange it for me? Thank you.\n
MID_MARTH_F_HOME5: ...I was thinking of my home and my\ncomrades. I'm not yet sure exactly\nwhy I came here...$k$pSomeday, I hope, I'll be able to tell\nyou more about these things.\n
MID_MARTH_F_FRIEND: You're $Nu?$k$pI've come with greetings for you from\n$Nf.
MID_MARTH_F_LEVEL1: If I keep this up, I can grow\nstrong—like my father!
MID_MARTH_F_LEVEL2: Excellent. I feel I'm improving.
MID_MARTH_F_LEVEL3: My apologies!
MID_MARTH_F_SKILL: This strength will not be wasted.\nI must continue to ask for your aid.\n
MID_MARTH_F_JOIN: You may call me Marth. I can say no\nmore than this just now. If you require\nmy help, I offer it to you.
MID_MARTH_F_STRONGEST: It has been some time since you\nsummoned me here. Really, I should\nbe elsewhere. And I am no Hero.$k$pI am grateful to you, though. I can use\nthe strength you've given me to fulfill\nthe mission that lies ahead.$k$pThe day will come when I have to\nleave, $Nu. $k$pI must return to the land so dear to\nme—the one where we all swore to\nmeet again...$k$pThe one where we promised we\nwould change our fates. When the\ntime comes, I hope I can explain.$k$pUnlike the other Heroes, I must guard\nmy secrets. I cannot open up to you.\nBut for now, my sword is yours.
