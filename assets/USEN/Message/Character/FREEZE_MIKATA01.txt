MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_HOME1: The peace of this realm depends on\nyou. That means your attention is as\nvaluable as any jewel in the treasury.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_HOME2: Thanks to everything you've done,\nNifl can rebuild. I will never forget the\ndebt we owe all of you.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_HOME3: Please, rest yourself, if only for a\nmoment. Fatigue clouds judgment...\nAllow me to keep watch in your stead.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_HOME4: I know I can come across as a little\ncold. I apologize. I'd love to share a\njoke, but that's not how I'm made.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_HOME5: As long as I live...I will never forget\nthat I failed in my duty to protect my\npeople and my sisters...
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_FRIEND: I am Hríd, eldest prince of Nifl,\nthe Kingdom of Ice. I bring word\nfrom $Nf.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_LEVEL1: This is exceedingly good,\nwouldn't you say?
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_LEVEL2: This, now... A reasonable result.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_LEVEL3: This, though... This is not\nsatisfactory.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_SKILL: Thank you. In order to protect that\nwhich I cherish, I need strength.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_JOIN: I am Hríd, eldest prince of Nifl, the\nKingdom of Ice. I pledge on my good\nname to be of aid to you.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_STRONGEST: My kingdom was as peaceful as\nany. Of others, we asked only for\nalliances, not conflict.$k$pNifl was as pure as the freshly fallen\nsnow, in other words. But once\nMúspell invaded, everything changed.$k$pA heart that desires only peace is\nprecious, but its bearer is easy prey.\nI learned that the hard way.$k$pEven if I want peace—no, BECAUSE\nI want peace—I must become strong.$k$pI must be the blade that secures our\nrealm. I can permit no further threat\nto Nifl's sovereignty.

MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE11: I am Hrid, the eldest prince of Nifl.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE12: Hm? Oh, sorry. It's going to take me a while to get used to that.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE13: My homeland is completely covered in snow, as far as the eye can see. I happen to think it's beautiful.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE14: You have warm hands.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE15: You're very mysterious. But spending time with you puts me at ease, all the same...
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE16: Protecting my homeland was my duty. And I failed in that duty.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE17: I will lend you my strength. Ask whatever you need of me. I'll do what I can.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE18: Understood.
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE19: What next?
MID_FREEZE_MIKATA01_VOICE20: Waiting for orders.
