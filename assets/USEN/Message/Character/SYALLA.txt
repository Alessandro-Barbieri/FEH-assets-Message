MID_SYALLA_HOME1: I'm rather curious about your\nsummoning capabilities... All I've ever\nbeen able to summon are monsters.
MID_SYALLA_HOME2: I was raised in the Deeprealms. It was\nnice. Dark, gloomy... The perfect\nplace to carry out my research.
MID_SYALLA_HOME3: Oh, $Nu.\nTell me if you start feeling drowsy.$k$pWhy? Oh, I made you my test subject\nfor a hex. It's supposed to make you\nnice and...cheery.
MID_SYALLA_HOME4: Usually I find white too blinding to look\nat, but your outfit is oddly bearable...\nMaybe we can chat again sometime.
MID_SYALLA_HOME5: I was raised in a place where time\nflows differently. By this world's flow, I\nshould technically still be an infant...
MID_SYALLA_FRIEND: I was entrusted with a greeting for you\nfrom $Nf.$k$pI consider a message a type of spell...\nThe type that can bind two hearts\ntogether.
MID_SYALLA_LEVEL1: Oh, this will come in handy...
MID_SYALLA_LEVEL2: How boring.
MID_SYALLA_LEVEL3: I must be cursed.
MID_SYALLA_SKILL: Hmm, good choice... You know\nme so well.
MID_SYALLA_JOIN: It's good to meet you. I am Rhajat...\ndaughter of the diviner Hayato.$k$pAnd I certainly won't object to helping\nsomeone like you...
MID_SYALLA_STRONGEST: Heehee... You're talking with me\nagain. I'm keeping a count of all the\ntimes we've spoken.$k$pBut the exact number is my little\nsecret, of course...$k$pIt's been a while since I arrived in this\nworld, and I'll be honest... It took\nsome getting used to.$k$pThe sun is too bright, and everything\nis just so...pretty.$k$pBut ever since you started spending\ntime with me, it feels like I've been\ncursed with...kindness.$k$pSomehow, I've come to like this\nplace.$k$pThat's why I'll fight alongside you to\nprotect this world. Well, and because\nI'd like to keep watch over you...$k$pThat's all I wanted to say. Now I'll go\nback to waiting around until you come\nchat with me again—so don't be shy.$k$pSee you soon... Heehee...
MID_SYALLA_VOICE01: Take that...
MID_SYALLA_VOICE02: Like this?
MID_SYALLA_VOICE03: ううっ…
MID_SYALLA_VOICE04: I'll curse you...
MID_SYALLA_VOICE05: Let's see what this does!
MID_SYALLA_VOICE06: Hope you like hell!
MID_SYALLA_VOICE07: You deserve it.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE08: You're still here?
MID_SYALLA_VOICE09: I won't forget this...
MID_SYALLA_VOICE10: Uhuhu...
MID_SYALLA_VOICE11: It must be fate that brought me here.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE12: My father is such a child...
MID_SYALLA_VOICE13: I was raised in a Deeprealm...but I'm also a member of the Wind Tribe.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE14: Is there anybody here I can experiment on? Uh, I mean any FACELESS here. Right.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE15: You...remind me of someone. Definitely.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE16: I wish it were more comfortable around here.\nIt's too bright, and too...dry.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE17: I have an idea for a new hex. If you want, I'll make it for you. I'm not sure why, but I want to help you.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE18: It's Rhajat.
MID_SYALLA_VOICE19: My turn?
MID_SYALLA_VOICE20: All right...
