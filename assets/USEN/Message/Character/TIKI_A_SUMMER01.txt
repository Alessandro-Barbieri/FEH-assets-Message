MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_HOME1: I'll guess the image that "3,000-year-\nold in a swimsuit" conjures up doesn't\nmatch the reality... Does it?
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_HOME2: That resort was beautiful...but far too\nhot to take a decent nap. I think I'll\nbe able to rest here, though.
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_HOME3: It's good to take a break now and\nagain. I just learned a fun game we\ncan play, actually...$k$pYou put on a blindfold and then try\nto smash a large melon. Want to try?
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_HOME4: Why don't you put on a bathing suit?\nLook at me—I'm the divine dragon's\noracle!$k$pIf I'm dressed like this, nobody will\neven blink to see the Summoner in\nsummer attire.
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_HOME5: Does the Askran Kingdom have\nbeautiful oceans?$k$pWe must do all we can to ensure the\nwaters of this kingdom do not run\nred...
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_FRIEND: I bring greetings from\n$Nf.$k$pMy attire? If you don't consider it\nappropriate for the circumstances, I\ncould always turn into a dragon.
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_LEVEL1: In a swimsuit, no less. At my age,\nyou take whatever you can get!
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_LEVEL2: Keeping cool in the summer—\nthat's my secret.
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_LEVEL3: Maybe I'm getting a little old to\nfight in a swimsuit...
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_SKILL: Thanks for this. I'll treasure my\nmemory of this summer with you.
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_JOIN: I'm Tiki, a descendant of the divine\ndragon tribe. I can take the form of a\ndragon, of course...$k$pBut for the summer, I'm liking the\nlook of this swimsuit a little bit better!\n
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_STRONGEST: Thanks for taking the time to come\nand see me, even with this heat... Or\nis it just me? $k$pWe Heroes who dropped in from the\nresort seem to be stuck in an eternal\nsummer... I'm not sure why.$k$pThis world is certainly mysterious. I've\nseen so many summers, but none\nhave been as thrilling as this one.$k$pI thought I'd gotten to an age where\nnothing could surprise me, but I was\nwrong about that!$k$pThis summer has filled me with the joy\nof a child. I find myself wishing it\nwould not end. $k$pI want to stay here with you.\n

MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_VOICE13: I'm ready to bury myself in the sand and take a long nap.
MID_TIKI_A_SUMMER01_VOICE14: Too much swimming makes my skin scaly.
