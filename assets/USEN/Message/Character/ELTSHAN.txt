MID_ELTSHAN_HOME1: Prince Alfonse seems thoughtful\nand considerate. He will be an\nexcellent ruler of this realm.
MID_ELTSHAN_HOME2: Oh, my dear sister, Lachesis...\nI know that I vowed to come back\nsoon, alive and well.$k$pBut circumstances have\nchanged.
MID_ELTSHAN_HOME3: In my world I was prepared to face\ndeath, but some twist of fate has\nbrought me here.$k$pPerhaps this too is part of the\ntangled nature of destiny.
MID_ELTSHAN_HOME4: A knight's loyalty must remain\nabsolute. My sister sees it differently,\nbut I cannot veer from duty.
MID_ELTSHAN_HOME5: My great friend Sigurd has a young\nson named Seliph. I wonder, in this\nunusual realm we stand in...$k$pcould I possibly meet Seliph as a\ngrown man—surely, a heroic figure like\nhis father? That would be marvelous.
MID_ELTSHAN_FRIEND: My name is Eldigan. I come bearing\nthe friendliest of greetings from\n$Nf.
MID_ELTSHAN_LEVEL1: I will reach for even loftier\ngoals. This I swear.
MID_ELTSHAN_LEVEL2: A knight must strive for the\nheights of excellence.
MID_ELTSHAN_LEVEL3: Inadequate. Has my grasp of\ngreatness slipped?
MID_ELTSHAN_SKILL: I vow to put this power to certain\npurpose.
MID_ELTSHAN_JOIN: I am Eldigan. Those who defy my lord\nwill meet my blade. But I trust that\nyou and I will have no such problem.
MID_ELTSHAN_STRONGEST: After I was summoned into this realm,\nI had a strange revelation.$k$pWhere I came from, I placed my\nabsolute loyalty in my lord. But\nhere, that lord is you.$k$pA knight of my caliber must serve\nhis lord—no matter what the\ncut of that lord.$k$pSo I have always believed. But I will\nconfess this, now that I have\nspent so much time with you.$k$pI am honored to pledge my sword\nto a master of your qualities.$k$pStill, a knight cannot choose his\nmaster, and so I count myself most\nfortunate to have met you.$k$pAgain and always—I forever pledge\nmy sword and my loyalty to you.

MID_ELTSHAN_VOICE12: What?! Oh, I thought you a foe. Employ prudence.
MID_ELTSHAN_VOICE13: What is chivalry but taking a friend's cause to heart?
