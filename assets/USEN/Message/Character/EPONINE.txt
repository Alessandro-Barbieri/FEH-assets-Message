MID_EPONINE_HOME2: I was raised in the Deeprealms, but\nsometimes I'd sneak out to pursue\nmy true calling as a chivalrous thief!
MID_EPONINE_HOME3: Consider this your lucky day! I'm\ngonna start going on patrols with you.\nWhat's with that look?$k$pIt's for your safety! You can't fight, so\nit's dangerous for you to go alone. I'll\nbe your bodyguard!
MID_EPONINE_HOME4: Is it just me, or does your weapon\nshare a special bond with Prince\nAlfonse's weapon?$k$pHey, let's store them beside each\nother in the armory and see if any\nsparks fly!
MID_EPONINE_HOME5: Oh, I was just reading this book—a\ntotally normal book. So don't even\nbother asking my parents about it!$k$pWhile we're on the topic, anything\nyou hear about my books or reading\nhabits is a complete lie. All right?
MID_EPONINE_FRIEND: Oh, now those two would make a\ngreat pair... Hehe—gyah! How long\nhave you been there?!$k$pHi from $Nf!\nBye!

EEK!\n$Nu?!$k$pWh-what's the big idea, huh? Speak\nup before approaching someone\nwho's daydreaming!$k$pI was just imagining what might\nhappen if a Summoner happened to\nsummon a certain Hero...$k$pDon't tell me that's not the best\ncombo! Summoner and summoned!\nA story of the bond they share...$k$pAnd the sad fate that awaits them\nas they're one day forced to return to\ntheir homes.$k$pIt practically writes itself because it\ndescribes us so— So...perfectly...\nHadn't thought about that before...$k$pKinda makes me sad. After all this\ntime we've spent together, one day...$k$pWell, let's not dwell on it. We've still\ngot a long way to go before we say\nour good-byes!$k$pI'll find all sorts of creative ways to\nkeep you happy until then...$k$pLike sending all our enemies up to\nthe heavens!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE01: たあっ！
MID_EPONINE_VOICE02: せやっ！
MID_EPONINE_VOICE03: んもう！
MID_EPONINE_VOICE04: What's the idea?!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE05: In your dreams...
MID_EPONINE_VOICE06: I spy a corpse.
MID_EPONINE_VOICE07: Here's a taste!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE08: Let's have some fun.
MID_EPONINE_VOICE09: I guess dreams don't come true…
MID_EPONINE_VOICE10: Hmm...
MID_EPONINE_VOICE11: What is it? It's not like I'm doing anything strange! Honest!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE12: If THAT Hero and THAT Hero were together... Oh, wow...
MID_EPONINE_VOICE13: Is my father here? It's not like I want to see him. I was just thinking about what a pain it would be if he was.
MID_EPONINE_VOICE14: You know, I used to be a thief. You should send me out to scout on the enemy!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE15: Ahh! Don't creep up on me like that! I was daydreaming! It was so nice, and you ruined it.
MID_EPONINE_VOICE16: If I could summon Heroes, I'd summon so many different people…
MID_EPONINE_VOICE17: There's so much to see here, so many people to... I mean, so many things to learn! I hope I get to stay!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE18: K!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE19: Nina time!
MID_EPONINE_VOICE20: Let me get a taste.
