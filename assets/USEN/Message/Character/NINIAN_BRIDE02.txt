MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_HOME1: I wonder if my parents had a wedding\nceremony before I was born...
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_HOME2: When I was traveling with my brother,\nwe stopped in a village and watched\na wedding ceremony.$k$pBut I never thought I'd one day be\ndressed for such an occasion.
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_HOME3: I must admit, I'm not well versed in\nwedding customs... Is it proper for a\nbride to dance in her dress?
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_HOME4: I heard that during a wedding, the\ncouple pledges their eternal love and\nthen they seal the vow with a kiss.$k$pIs...th-that true?
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_HOME5: Are you tired? One of my dances may\nperk you up. Would you like to see?
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_FRIEND: I've brought you a gift from\n$Nf. Oh, um...\nPardon my attire...
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_LEVEL1: This strength is all for that special\nsomeone.
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_LEVEL2: I'll do my best to bring happiness\nto all those around me!
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_LEVEL3: Perhaps this outfit isn't suitable\nfor battle...
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_SKILL: Thank you so much. I'll make\nsure it goes to good use.
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_JOIN: Before you ask, I'm dressed for a\nbridal festival. And, um... My name is\nNinian... Pleased to meet you.
MID_NINIAN_BRIDE02_STRONGEST: I once stopped in a village and saw a\nwedding ceremony. The couple\nlooked so happy together.$k$pI remember how the bride's smile was\nso bright, it filled me with joy as well.$k$pThat sort of happiness, though...\nWell, I know it's meant only for\nhumans.$k$pBut when I wear this dress, I feel like\nI'm in a dream. And even if it's just for\na moment... I'm happy.$k$pHm? Maybe you're right... Maybe\nsomeday, I will be able to smile just\nlike that bride.$k$pAnd not just while in a dream.\nThank you so much,\n$Nu.
