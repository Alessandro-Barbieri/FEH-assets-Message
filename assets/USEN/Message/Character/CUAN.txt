MID_CUAN_HOME1: The sense of calm I feel here brings\nme back to my days at the academy.$k$pBack then, my friends and I made a\nvow to one another...
MID_CUAN_HOME2: Though Leonster may be small, our\nblood is that of Njörun, one of the 12\ncrusaders.$k$pMy cause would bring no shame to\nour line, and my father saw that it\nwas just, too. And yet...
MID_CUAN_HOME3: So restless you are! I have yet to see\nyou idle. If the castle must be\npatrolled, let me take your place.
MID_CUAN_HOME4: Being unable to ride into battle on\nhorseback puts you at a\ndisadvantage, I'd say.$k$pIf you'd like to learn to ride, I'd be\nglad to teach you.
MID_CUAN_HOME5: I was just tidying my things—it's\nbecome a habit. If there's a mess,\nmy wife will let me know about it.$k$pOn that remark, I'd thank you to keep\nmy confidence.
MID_CUAN_FRIEND: I am Quan, and I bring greetings from\n$Nf.$k$pMay your friendship never falter.
MID_CUAN_LEVEL1: I am the descendant of a crusader.\nStrength is my heritage.
MID_CUAN_LEVEL2: I must be vigilant and move ever\nforward.
MID_CUAN_LEVEL3: Weakness may be a prelude to\nfailure, I fear.
MID_CUAN_SKILL: On this lance, I swear that I will\nexert myself to my utmost on your\nbehalf.
MID_CUAN_JOIN: I am Quan, prince of Leonster. With\nme I carry the blood of the crusader\nNjörun and her lance, the Gáe Bolg.
MID_CUAN_STRONGEST: Some time has passed since first we\nfought together... I am now certain\nyou possess great skill.$k$pIf you had been there then...$k$pBut no. I have something more\npressing to discuss. What I want to\nask is this: Why do you fight?$k$pHow do you find meaning in battle?\nWhat goal motivates you?$k$pI was met by defeat and lost\neverything...$k$pEven so, I still believe my actions will\nreverberate into the future.$k$pTruly, I have no idea what effect\nthose actions will have on the final\noutcome...$k$pBut I must hold strong to my will to\nfight. The alternative is too terrifying\nto contemplate.$k$pAs long as you carry justice in your\nheart, I will be by your side, Gáe Bolg\nin hand.$k$pLet us move forward without\nhesitation, my friend.
MID_CUAN_VOICE01: はっ！

MID_CUAN_VOICE05: You face the Gáe Bolg!

MID_CUAN_VOICE09: Ethlyn... I'm sorry...
MID_CUAN_VOICE10: Sigh
MID_CUAN_VOICE11: My bond of friendship with Sigurd is unbreakable. Now that I have wed Ethlyn, we are brothers!
MID_CUAN_VOICE12: Our Leonster may be a small country, but it is ruled by the descendants of the crusader Njörun.
MID_CUAN_VOICE13: Even if I fall into ruin, I will never regret my choice -- as long as I fight for what is right.
MID_CUAN_VOICE14: When we were just boys studying together, Sigurd, Eldigan, and I shared our dreams for the future.
MID_CUAN_VOICE15: Have you ever made a mistake? One that haunts you, even now?
MID_CUAN_VOICE16: As long as I have the Gáe Bolg, I will not lose.
MID_CUAN_VOICE17: You must not lose your life here. If you were to be placed in danger, I would do everything I could to save you.
MID_CUAN_VOICE18: Yes.
MID_CUAN_VOICE19: Ready to go?
MID_CUAN_VOICE20: My strength.
