MID_OBORO_HOME1: Good thing you wear white. I grew\nup hating dark clothing. Like,\nreally, really hating!$k$pSo if you ever catch me making\na scary face, that's probably\nwhat's on my mind.
MID_OBORO_HOME2: I'm Lord Takumi's retainer. He's so\nstrong, beautiful, noble... *sigh*\nCouldn't be happier to serve him.
MID_OBORO_HOME3: I heard you're not equipped to enter\nbattle. No problem. I'll use my lance to\nprotect you. Need to keep you safe!
MID_OBORO_HOME4: I'm curious what the fashions are\nlike in this realm. Let's go find a tailor\nshop or clothing store sometime!
MID_OBORO_HOME5: So, you were summoned here\nsuddenly too? I bet you don't have\na change of clothes.$k$pI'll make you something!
MID_OBORO_FRIEND: Oh, I really like your style!\nBy any chance, are you\n$Nu?$k$pI'm here to say hello from\n$Nf!
MID_OBORO_LEVEL1: Now that makes a statement!
MID_OBORO_LEVEL2: One step at a time!
MID_OBORO_LEVEL3: Sorry. That didn't make me look\nvery good.
MID_OBORO_SKILL: For all my talk of fashion, it's\nwhat's inside that counts.
MID_OBORO_JOIN: My name is Oboro. I'm a spear\nfighter from Hoshido—and a pretty\ngreat tailor, if I say so myself!
MID_OBORO_STRONGEST: Oh, is something wrong,\n$Nu?$k$pYou haven't ruined your nice clothes,\nhave you? Or ripped a stitch? Or\nspilled soup on yourself?$k$pOh, I'm only kidding. I know you\ncome around for more than\nmy needle and thread.$k$pYou know, I do like it when I see\nyou in your nice, clean uniform.\nIt's so dapper!$k$pI like it even more when you don't\nget blood all over it—means you've\ncome back safe from battle!$k$pClothes can always be replaced,\nbut you're one of a kind. I just\ncouldn't do without you.$k$pSo I promise to always protect\nyou...and to help you keep your\nuniform in top shape!
MID_OBORO_VOICE01: どう？
MID_OBORO_VOICE02: せいやぁ！
MID_OBORO_VOICE03: ひゃっ！
MID_OBORO_VOICE04: My clothes!
MID_OBORO_VOICE05: Oh, that's it!
MID_OBORO_VOICE06: You're gonna need stitches.
MID_OBORO_VOICE07: I'll tear a hole in you!
MID_OBORO_VOICE08: Coming through!
MID_OBORO_VOICE09: What...?
MID_OBORO_VOICE10: Haha
MID_OBORO_VOICE11: Oh, did you need something?
MID_OBORO_VOICE12: The clothing you and your friends wear here is very stylish. Impressed!
MID_OBORO_VOICE13: I love to make clothing when I'm off duty. So, I'd kill for some good fabric. Have any?
MID_OBORO_VOICE14: You would not believe the scary face I make when I get really, really angry!
MID_OBORO_VOICE15: I'm particular about my clothes. But when it's time to fight...? I get dressed in a flash!
MID_OBORO_VOICE16: Oh, Lord Takumi... Where are you? I should be with you!
MID_OBORO_VOICE17: I like to keep my stitching abilities in top shape. So I'll mend everyone's clothing after battle!
MID_OBORO_VOICE18: OK.
MID_OBORO_VOICE19: Ready.
MID_OBORO_VOICE20: Do my best.
