MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_HOME1: I feel a little ill at ease in this\nswimsuit... What if I were to run into\nChrom? What then, I ask? What then?
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_HOME2: It seems that wearing a swimsuit puts\nyou on edge, too... I know that feeling.\nThis outfit is so revealing!$k$pThere's nothing practical about it...\nWhen it comes to battle, at any rate!\nDon't you agree?
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_HOME3: You want to play on the beach?\nWell... Right. There's no reason to\nstand here being embarrassed!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_HOME4: I've tried a lot of different exercise\nregimens... I'm trying to build on\nmy strengths.$k$pIf I work hard enough, that might\nhave some ancillary benefits, too...
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_HOME5: The ocean is beautiful... It reminds\nme of a trip I took, once. Water so\nclear that it glittered like jewels...
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_FRIEND: Hot today, isn't it? I've got some\nchilled juice for you to share. It's from\n$Nf!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_LEVEL1: No matter how I am dressed,\neffort brings results.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_LEVEL2: I may be a bit uneasy, but I'm still\ngetting stronger!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_LEVEL3: This is the worst... How\nembarrassing.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_SKILL: This swimsuit won't hold me\nback... I think! Right?
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_JOIN: My name is Cordelia. I pledge to aid\nyou however I can, so long as I am\nhere.$k$pA knight in a swimsuit... Unusual, I\nknow.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_STRONGEST: Are you tired already? I think you may\nneed to spend more time on training.\nDon't skip a day, either.$k$pI can tell by your expression that you\nthought today would be a little more...\nrelaxing.$k$pSorry to disappoint, but summertime\ntraining for a pegasus knight is always\nintense.$k$pWe always have to be prepared. I'm\nconcerned that you aren't ready for\nbattlefield emergencies...$k$pYou can't stay on the sidelines\nforever. And I'm happy to help whip\nyou into shape.$k$pWell... We did complete today's\ntraining regimen. So we can take it\neasy for the rest of the day.$k$pIf you want to goof off, you have to\nearn it. I'll race you to those rocks\nover there—then we can play!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE01: せやっ！
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE02: どうかしら！
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE03: ええっ！？
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE04: そこはだめーっ！
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE05: I'll cool you down!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE06: Tropical attack!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE07: Summer must prevail!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE08: Out of my sun!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE09: The ocean, so deep, so dark...
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE10: What is it?
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE11: One thing led to another and, well, I ended up in this swimsuit.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE12: If you get too hot, take a break. You wouldn't want to collapse in battle.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE13: The blue water, the rhythm of the waves... The ocean is so romantic.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE14: Adding seashells to a lance can give it just the right amount of exotic flair! And they're aerodynamic, too.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE15: What's wrong? Did I have some sand stuck to me?
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE16: I'm not quite filling out this swimsuit the way I want to!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE17: I had so much fun on the beach with the rest of the Shepherds. Next time, let's all go!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE18: Right.
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE19: So hot!
MID_TIAMO_SUMMER03_VOICE20: Take it easy!
