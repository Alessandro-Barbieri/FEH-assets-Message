MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_HOME1: Oh, this? It's a hagoita. In Hoshido,\nwe use these to play a game called\nhanetsuki. I've never lost a match.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_HOME2: Every year, the first trip I make is to a\nshrine. So imagine my surprise when\nI instead found myself in some ruins!$k$pI guess this year my first trip is to visit\na powerful summoner instead.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_HOME3: Doesn't all of the bustle around the\nnew year make you hungry? It isn't\nmuch, but I did bring some osechi.$k$pThat's what we call the foods we eat\nat the start of a new year. They can\nbe quite a feast sometimes!
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_HOME4: Who was the first Hero you\nsummoned this year? They were the\nfirst to answer your call, so...$k$pWell, you should hold that memory\nespecially dear.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_HOME5: Just...like...this! Adjusting the obi on a\nkimono seems complicated, but it's\nsimple once you get the hang of it.$k$pIf you ever want to try wearing one, I'd\nbe happy to teach you the proper way\nto put it on.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_FRIEND: Happy New Year. I bear the greetings\nof $Nf.$k$pMay your friendship blossom in this\nnew year!
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL1: An auspicious start to the year.\nHow delightful.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL2: I hope I can grow strong like\nthis each and every year.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_LEVEL3: An ill omen... As though I pulled\na bad fortune from a shrine.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_SKILL: Is this your New Year's gift to me?\nThank you.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_JOIN: Happy New Year! I'm Azura. I was\nheading out for my first shrine visit\nof the new year, but...$k$pSomehow I wound up here, instead.
MID_AQUA_NEWYEAR01_STRONGEST: I just love New Year's. The crisp air at\nthe break of dawn truly makes it feel\nlike a new start.$k$pHmm, I know... Let's celebrate with a\nsong, shall we? What kind of music\ndo you enjoy?$k$pI like songs that remind me of people\nfrom my past. To be honest, those\nsongs can make me feel lonely...$k$pBut when I sing them, I feel like my\nthoughts and feelings can reach\nsomeone no matter the distance.$k$pThough, maybe it's best to ring in the\nnew year with a happier song.$k$pI don't want to sing for people who\nare far away. I'd rather sing for you,\nright here in front of me.$k$pI'm so happy to have met you. I'll sing\nto show you my gratitude, so I hope\nI can stay by your side all year.
