MID_KLEINE_HOME1: Hmpf...Heroes...from other worlds...\nI bet there's at least one of them\nwho's not totally loyal to you.$k$pYou give the word, and then I'll\nget rid of whomever it is.\nPermanently.
MID_KLEINE_HOME2: Reese is not my sister. Maybe she\nand I made some pledge when\nwe were children.$k$pBut that was then, and this is\nnow. Who'd hold to silly promises\nlike that anyway?
MID_KLEINE_HOME3: Hey, you. You're going to way too\nmuch trouble for everyone's sakes.\nTake a break, will you?$k$pIf you don't, I might just have to\ngive you a permanent nap\nwith my bow here.
MID_KLEINE_HOME4: Sure I follow your orders, but don't\nget the wrong idea. I'm...I'm just\nbound by a contract, all right?
MID_KLEINE_HOME5: Hey, if I fail miserably in battle and\nyou don't want to keep me\naround anymore...$k$pOh, forget it. Do what you need to.
MID_KLEINE_FRIEND: Don't worry. I'm not going to put an\narrow in you. Just delivering a hello\nfrom $Nf.
MID_KLEINE_LEVEL1: Wow! But then again, I'd\nexpect nothing less.
MID_KLEINE_LEVEL2: Huh. Good enough to prove\nyou shouldn't throw me out.
MID_KLEINE_LEVEL3: No, anything but this! Don't\nlook at me.
MID_KLEINE_SKILL: Hmpf. Well, I won't be totally\nungrateful about this.
MID_KLEINE_JOIN: I'm Clarisse. I'm a cut above all the\nother rubbish you probably see\naround here.
MID_KLEINE_STRONGEST: I've been thinking about something.\nLots of time has gone by since\nI got here.$k$pI've maybe helped you more\nthan I like...but also sneered at\nyou more than I should.$k$pStill, the longer I'm here in the\ncastle, I wonder if this is what\nhaving a family feels like.$k$pHey! Get that smile off your face.\nI'm only wondering! Not saying\nit's what I want!$k$pSeriously, never bring this up again.\nOr else I'll have to—you know,\nput an arrow in your hide.$k$pAll right then, have we reached\nan understanding? Good.

MID_KLEINE_VOICE10: huhu
MID_KLEINE_VOICE11: What? Need my help or something?
MID_KLEINE_VOICE12: Ah! Good way to wind up in a grave.
MID_KLEINE_VOICE13: Don't pretend like we're friends.
MID_KLEINE_VOICE14: Why are you nice to me?!
MID_KLEINE_VOICE15: This kindness is getting old.
MID_KLEINE_VOICE16: Alone...as always...
