MID_SERGE_HOME1: Oh, what an adorable insect!\nI'll have to catch it and show\nit off to $Nu...
MID_SERGE_HOME2: In my homeland, I was in service to\nHouse Virion, but, honestly, you can\njust forget about my former liege.
MID_SERGE_HOME3: It's kind of you to check on me, but\nI'm sure you're busy. Stop by and\nchat when you've got more time.
MID_SERGE_HOME4: Say, would you like to go hunting with\nMinerva and me sometime? It's so\ncute when she eats a whole deer!
MID_SERGE_HOME5: I've sewn up all the torn uniforms.\nLet me know if you need help with\nthe stains on those white capes.
MID_SERGE_FRIEND: So, you there. You're the one called\n$Nu, right?$k$pI've come to deliver a hello to you\nfrom $Nf.
MID_SERGE_LEVEL1: I feel invigorated! How about\nyou, Minerva?
MID_SERGE_LEVEL2: See, Minerva? This is the\nvalue of hard work.
MID_SERGE_LEVEL3: Well, this is vexing.
MID_SERGE_SKILL: I feel simply fantastic! Thank you\never so much!
MID_SERGE_JOIN: I'm Cherche, a wyvern rider from\nValm. My sweet Minerva and I\nwill join your cause.
MID_SERGE_STRONGEST: Thank you for always supporting\nme and my precious Minerva. We\nboth feel so safe with you!$k$pTo be honest, I was worried at first.\nAbout living in a different world...\nAbout fighting new enemies...$k$pI did leave home once before, but\ncoming here is not the same as\ncrossing from Valm to Ylisse.$k$pBut spending time with you—learning\nabout this world—has filled me with\ndetermination to protect it.$k$pMy homeland of Rosanne is a green\nand beautiful place, just like Askr.\nI hope to show it to you someday.

MID_SERGE_VOICE12: If you have time, let's chat together awhile.
MID_SERGE_VOICE13: Some say I'm terrifying when angry, but that's simply not true.
MID_SERGE_VOICE14: I used to be a servant—now I ride a wyvern into battle. Life is strange, is it not?

MID_SERGE_VOICE20: Minerva?
