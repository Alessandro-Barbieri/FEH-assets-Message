MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_HOME1: I got envious of Chrom and the others\nin their swimsuits, so I tried one on...$k$pLook at me now! Summoned to\nanother world... I didn't expect that!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_HOME2: I had so much fun at the resort! I\nhelped out a friend with body oil,\nfed another one coconut brittle...$k$pI even threw lances and caught a\nweird creature in a tide pool!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_HOME3: Put me on the front lines! This\nswimsuit may not offer much\nprotection, I admit...$k$pBut a true tactician adjusts their\nstrategy along with their outfit!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_HOME4: I'd love it if you and I took a trip to the\nsea together, someday...$k$pI don't have many memories, so I'd\nlove to see something besides a\nbattlefield.
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_HOME5: I've been keeping my eyes peeled...\nSeems like I'm one of the few who's\ndressed in so little. I feel...exposed.
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_FRIEND: Greetings to you from your friend\n$Nf!$k$pThis swimsuit? It'll throw off the\nenemy's concentration! Tell me, can\nyou focus on battle right now? Nope!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_LEVEL1: My plan for summer fun is paying\noff!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_LEVEL2: This clothing is so light that I can\nmove around with ease.
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_LEVEL3: What I didn't factor in was\nsunstroke...
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_SKILL: You have plans for me? Great!\nLet's tackle the summer together!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_JOIN: Hi, I'm Robin. I may have been on\nvacation in the Outrealms...$k$pBut I can't turn my back on anyone\nwho needs a sound battle strategy!
MID_REFLET_F_SUMMER01_STRONGEST: We did a good job out there, despite\nthe heat. Did you lose focus during\nthe battle? No? That's good!$k$pAt the resort, fighting in the heat didn't\nbother me one bit, but here...it does.\nIt's strange.$k$pMaybe it's because there, I was\nfocused on strategy! You know what\nI'm talking about, don't you?$k$pI'm so glad we met. It's nice to have\nanother tactician to talk to. You\nunderstand what I'm saying... $k$pI had a great time at the resort, but I\nthink it's even more fun to talk about\nstrategy like this.$k$pAnd it doesn't hurt that you're letting\nme take a vacation from being a\ntactician during battle!$k$pI hope we can keep talking like this...\nTwo tacticians, striving for the ultimate\nstrategy!
