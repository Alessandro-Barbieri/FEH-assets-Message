MID_ALVIS_HOME1: This world is beautiful indeed. But it\nbears little resemblance to the world\nI'm building—one founded on ideals.
MID_ALVIS_HOME2: The world I came from is on the\nverge of a new era. It's engulfed in\nwar... But not for long, I think.
MID_ALVIS_HOME3: You're always rushing here and there.\nYour life is fraught with hardship—I\nsuppose we have that in common.
MID_ALVIS_HOME4: Ideals never become reality without\nsacrifices... Sacrifices only a few\ncould ever countenance.
MID_ALVIS_HOME5: I dealt with the usurper—I had no\nchoice. To build a just world, Sigurd\nhad to die.
MID_ALVIS_FRIEND: I am Arvis. I was sent as an envoy of\n$Nf.
MID_ALVIS_LEVEL1: Any who stand in my path will be\nburnt to cinders!
MID_ALVIS_LEVEL2: I must grow stronger.
MID_ALVIS_LEVEL3: Completely unacceptable!
MID_ALVIS_SKILL: I'm a champion of the people—\nlike the crusaders before me.
MID_ALVIS_JOIN: I am Arvis. I descend from the\ncrusaders Fjalar and Maera.
MID_ALVIS_STRONGEST: How do you envision this world?\nWhat form do you think it should take,\n$Nu?$k$pCast aside trifles, like who won or\nlost yesterday's battle. What are your\nplans for shaping the world?$k$pYou understand what I'm getting at,\ndon't you? People like us...we have\nthe power to change the world.$k$pYour abilities are remarkable.\nUnderstand, then, that I believe it\nis your duty to guide this world.$k$pI, myself, will not stop until I can return\nto my world and mold it into its ideal\nform.$k$pFor the sake of that task, I ask you:\nWhat sort of world would you like to\nsee? I must hear your answer.\n

MID_ALVIS_VOICE10: Hmmpt
MID_ALVIS_VOICE11: Well, now. Let's see what you're capable of.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE12: What is it that you think you're doing? You're getting awfully familiar.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE13: If you can only understand one thing, make it this: I have no intention of bowing to your will.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE14: I'm willing to burn the world with my hellfire.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE15: To make my ideals a reality, I'd sacrifice anything...or anyone.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE16: I will remake the world—tear down divisions and make things equitable for all.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE17: So tell me! I want to know what it is that you believe in.
MID_ALVIS_VOICE18: Out with it!
MID_ALVIS_VOICE19: What's your gambit?
MID_ALVIS_VOICE20: Of course.
