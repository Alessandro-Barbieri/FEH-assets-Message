MID_LEYVAN_HOME1: Like I said, I'm just a mercenary.\nNot really the type to rub elbows\nwith any royalty around here.
MID_LEYVAN_HOME2: People say I look mad all the time.\nThey can say what they want. If I\nhear it, though? Then I get mad.
MID_LEYVAN_HOME3: I have to give it to you. You fight\nwith brains, not brawn. Wish I\nhad the knack for that.
MID_LEYVAN_HOME4: I have my reasons for fighting, and\nfor pushing myself to get stronger, and\nfor getting flexible with weapons.
MID_LEYVAN_HOME5: I used to rely on a sword, but the\nstronger I get, I think the axe\nsuits me better.
MID_LEYVAN_FRIEND: My business here is with\n$Nu.$k$pThat you? I'm here on behalf of\nsomeone else.
MID_LEYVAN_LEVEL1: Couldn't hope for better.
MID_LEYVAN_LEVEL2: Fine results.
MID_LEYVAN_LEVEL3: Not nearly enough. No way.
MID_LEYVAN_SKILL: Power? Like this? You have my\nthanks.
MID_LEYVAN_JOIN: I'm Raven. Just a mercenary.\nNothing more to it.
MID_LEYVAN_STRONGEST: It's nothing worth talking about, but\nthere's something I might as well\ntell you, $Nu.$k$pA long time ago, I was from a\nroyal house—a house that was\ndestroyed by our enemies.$k$pThat was why I became a\nmercenary—to seek revenge\non those who did it.$k$pI sought power—and always more\nof it—to better exact my revenge.$k$pBut now, none of that matters.\nI've come to my senses after\nwatching you at work here.$k$pDoes any of that make sense?\nIf not, forget I said anything.\nI'll still fight hard for you.
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE01: はぁっ！
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE02: ふっ！
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE04: That was unfortunate...

MID_LEYVAN_VOICE08: Settle down.
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE09: Better than this...
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE10: Heh
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE11: I take it we're here to discuss something?
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE12: Is this touching stuff some sort of amusement?
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE13: Likes? Dislikes? Oh, I don't know. I like meat, I guess?
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE14: People say I scowl. Hmph. What do they know?
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE15: I'm not angry. This is just my face.
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE16: Glad to fight for you. Long as it doesn't get in the way of...well, never mind.
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE17: Need me? Just say so.
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE18: Yes?
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE19: Ready?
MID_LEYVAN_VOICE20: Let's go.
