MID_LYON_HOME1: Ephraim is strong, and he cuts a\ndashing figure. When it comes to\nhis studies, though...$k$pOf course, he did rely on my help for\nthat. I was very glad to aid him.
MID_LYON_HOME2: My kingdom, Grado, can be a harsh\nand inhospitable place. Still, I do love\nmy homeland.

MID_LYON_STRONGEST: To tell the truth...some of my\nmemories from before I came to this\nworld...are lost.$k$pIt's all so indistinct, as though a fog\nhas been cast on them. And other\nthings, I can't remember at all...$k$pI feel like I may have done some\nthings that would make the people\ndear to me so very sad.$k$pOh, $Nu...$k$pYou are far too kind. Please don't\nlook at me so. I want to see you\nsmile. Always.$k$pI had friends back home who worried\nabout me just as you do... Dear friends.$k$pEphraim, Eirika... I hope that someday,\nwe can gather together for a good,\nlong chat.
