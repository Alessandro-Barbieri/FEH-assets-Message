MID_CREA_HOME1: The uniforms that those in the Order\nof Heroes wear are splendid. I wonder\nif they'd let me wear one...$k$pI think the look would suit me very\nwell, don't you?
MID_CREA_HOME2: I was a knight of Zofia until\nChancellor Desaix's coup d'etat. My\ndear brother was right there with me.
MID_CREA_HOME3: Worried about me? Oh, you! It's really\nnot necessary. You just take good\ncare of yourself, all right?
MID_CREA_HOME4: I'd love for you to join me for a lovely\ncup of tea, and I'd even do you the\nhonor of preparing it myself.
MID_CREA_HOME5: I should write letters to everyone\nback at our family manor. To\nFather and Mother, of course!$k$pBut also to all our servants, the\nmaid, and the nursemaid... Oh!\nAnd our private tutor, too.
MID_CREA_FRIEND: I have come to bring you greetings\nfrom $Nf.$k$pHow nice for you!
MID_CREA_LEVEL1: A fine result, quite fitting for\na noble.
MID_CREA_LEVEL2: Hmm. I suppose that will do.
MID_CREA_LEVEL3: A tad unsatisfying.
MID_CREA_SKILL: Now I'll be certain to shine for\nall the world forevermore!
MID_CREA_JOIN: My name is Clair. I battle alongside\nmy dear brother in the Deliverance\nforces that fight for Zofia.$k$pWhat fortune that you should\nmeet me like this!
MID_CREA_STRONGEST: Ah, there you are, my fine friend\n$Nu!$k$pI was just thinking how nice it\nwould be to see your face.\nWhy, you ask?$k$pI suppose I've taken a liking to\nyou. Is there something so very\nstrange about that?$k$pYes? No? Perhaps? Well, let's\nthrow caution to the wind. It's\nundeniable we have a bond.$k$pIt's quite mysterious, and perhaps\neven fate. But I hope you don't\nmisunderstand.$k$pMy heart's fondest affections are\nreserved for Alm— Oh! Please\nforget I said that.$k$pStill, here is what I meant to say.\nYou have somehow become\nvery dear to me. That is all.

MID_CREA_VOICE11: I just couldn't be prouder of my brother.
MID_CREA_VOICE12: My, my...
MID_CREA_VOICE13: That Alm can be so distant.
MID_CREA_VOICE14: I would give all I have if it would bring peace to this world.
MID_CREA_VOICE15: I can't help but feel a little jealous of Mathilda's skill.
MID_CREA_VOICE16: Honestly, I think Alm knows...
