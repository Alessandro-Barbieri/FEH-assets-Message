MID_KATARINA_HOME1: The idea of fighting beside those\nI've read about in books makes\nme...a bit nervous.
MID_KATARINA_HOME2: I was very close to my friend\nClarisse. We were orphans, and we\nswore...to look after each other.
MID_KATARINA_HOME3: Don't work yourself too hard, and\nbe sure to get rest. If you can't\nsleep...I could sing you a lullaby.
MID_KATARINA_HOME4: You do such a splendid job as a\ntactician. I once studied for such a\nrole...but decided it wasn't for me.
MID_KATARINA_HOME5: I wonder if we have ever met before,\n$Nu.$k$pPerhaps in the world I'm from?
MID_KATARINA_FRIEND: Hello. My name is Katarina.\nI've come to deliver a hello\nfrom $Nf.
MID_KATARINA_LEVEL1: I did it! I only hope...that you're\nproud of me.
MID_KATARINA_LEVEL2: That wasn't too bad, was it?
MID_KATARINA_LEVEL3: Poorly done. I'm sorry. Please\ndon't be disappointed.
MID_KATARINA_SKILL: This means so much to me.\nI'd do anything for you.
MID_KATARINA_JOIN: Please, call me Katarina. I once\nplanned to be a tactician, but that...\ndidn't work out. I have magic though!
MID_KATARINA_STRONGEST: In my world, there was someone very\ndear to me. You've always reminded\nme of that person.$k$pThat person was like a Hero to me\nbut is neither in this world or\nthat one.$k$pSo I did some reading about other\nworlds here, and I came to a\ncurious conclusion.$k$pYou are that person.$k$pI know...I know... It makes no sense.\nPerhaps it's even unsettling to\nhear such a thing!$k$pWhether I am wrong or you simply\ndon't recall those days, I pledge\nmy service to you fully.$k$pI'm not sure I'm always the most\ncompetent person in your group, but\nI will always give you my best!
MID_KATARINA_VOICE01: えいっ！
MID_KATARINA_VOICE02: それっ！
MID_KATARINA_VOICE03: きゃああっ！
MID_KATARINA_VOICE04: That was... not what I planned...
MID_KATARINA_VOICE05: I will defeat you!
MID_KATARINA_VOICE06: It's time to end this!
MID_KATARINA_VOICE07: Sorry to do this...
MID_KATARINA_VOICE08: I've come to finish you.
MID_KATARINA_VOICE09: My dream...
MID_KATARINA_VOICE10: hehe
MID_KATARINA_VOICE11: Is there something I can do for you?
MID_KATARINA_VOICE12: I'm so sorry. For—? Oh, just sorry.
MID_KATARINA_VOICE13: If it ever helps, I once studied to be a tactician.
MID_KATARINA_VOICE14: You're such a great tactician. Could you teach me to be the same?
MID_KATARINA_VOICE15: I will do anything that you request of me.
MID_KATARINA_VOICE16: How can I ever atone for...what I did?
MID_KATARINA_VOICE17: I'm delighted that you accepted me into your group.
MID_KATARINA_VOICE18: Yes?
MID_KATARINA_VOICE19: Your command?
MID_KATARINA_VOICE20: Ready.
