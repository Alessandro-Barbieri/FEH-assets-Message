MID_TAKUMI_HOME1: So, you've got a divine weapon too?\nLooks like it's hard to aim. But it\nreally isn't for battle, is it?
MID_TAKUMI_HOME2: My retainers are Hinata and Oboro.\nThey work hard, so I'm glad they\nknow how to relax.$k$pHonestly, I can't help spoiling\nthose two.
MID_TAKUMI_HOME3: I heard you can't fight, so you can\ncount on me...no matter what\nsome people say behind my back.
MID_TAKUMI_HOME4: I like the food of my homeland.\nEspecially miso soup. Maybe you and\nI can cook something up like that.
MID_TAKUMI_HOME5: I always keep my Fujin Yumi nice and\npolished. I'm only as good as my\nweapon. Best to keep it in top shape.
MID_TAKUMI_FRIEND: I'm here to give you a fine hello\nfrom $Nf.$k$pNow, you be sure to stay in touch.
MID_TAKUMI_LEVEL1: Phew! Nice growth! What a\nrelief.
MID_TAKUMI_LEVEL2: All right. Not bad. Not bad\nat all!
MID_TAKUMI_LEVEL3: What? It happens!
MID_TAKUMI_SKILL: Heh. Nice to see that you're really\ntaking an interest.
MID_TAKUMI_JOIN: I'm Takumi, a prince of Hoshido and\nwielder of the divine Fujin Yumi. Which\nmakes me pretty useful, I'd say.
MID_TAKUMI_STRONGEST: I've been wondering... How do you\nthink of me? Am I just another\nHero to you?$k$pNot that it matters to me. Just\ncurious. But I feel like you\nacknowledge me and my skill.$k$pIf you didn't, why would you spend\nso much time looking out for me?\n...I appreciate that, by the way.$k$pI guess that's all I ever wanted—\nto be acknowledged for my own\nabilities. Thank you.$k$pNow just you watch—I'll be the\nstrongest Hero you've ever\nknown.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE01: せやっ！
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE02: Hit!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE03: うわっ！
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE04: How dare you?
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE05: Oh, that's it!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE06: Die already!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE07: I'll shoot you down!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE08: You'll never hit this target!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE09: By you?!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE10: Hmmm.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE11: Must be nice to have free time. Ugh. Sorry, I didn't mean that.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE12: I have nightmares that you wouldn't believe. I wish they'd go away.\n\n
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE13: Don't worry. I'll obliterate anyone who gets in our way!
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE14: Were you happy to see me when I showed up? Hope so.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE15: I have to get stronger! Way stronger! More than my siblings, anyway.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE16: Are Hinata and Oboro around? Not that I need them to relax or anything.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE17: Heh, nice to be needed. But nice to get compliments too.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE18: Yes?
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE19: On it.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE20: Let's go.
MID_TAKUMI_VOICE21: Need me? All right. I'll help.
