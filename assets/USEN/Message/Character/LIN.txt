MID_LIN_HOME1: I love the feel of the wind. It's always\na balm for whatever's bothering me.
MID_LIN_HOME2: Wielding a sword is useful for more\nthan battle. I find that it also gives me\na peek into another person's thoughts.$k$pSo, I think I might know what's on\nyour mind, friend!
MID_LIN_HOME3: Good job out there. You be sure to\nstay well rested. You carry the\nheaviest load of all of us.
MID_LIN_HOME4: We should find a hill and look out\nacross the world. People really\ndon't do that nearly enough.
MID_LIN_HOME5: I may look calm—maybe even still.\nBut I'm really very focused. It's part\nof my daily training with my sword.
MID_LIN_FRIEND: I've been asked to come visit\nyou here by your friend\n$Nf.$k$pNow, may your friendship\nalways remain strong!
MID_LIN_LEVEL1: The winds of my homeland are\nblessing me today!
MID_LIN_LEVEL2: Oh, good! That seems pretty fair.
MID_LIN_LEVEL3: Not good at all. I'd better train\nmore often.
MID_LIN_SKILL: Thank you. Good to get stronger.
MID_LIN_JOIN: I'm Lyndis of the House of Caelin.\nYet I truly belong to the open\nplains. Just call me Lyn, all right?
MID_LIN_STRONGEST: I'd like to offer my thanks today.\nIt's for all the times you've helped me.\nNothing more, nothing less.$k$pBut while I'm at it, I should also\nthank you for giving me courage\nand never failing to be kind.$k$pThose are rarer qualities than\nyou'd think. In fact...$k$pI think you're as precious to me\nas the breeze that blows across\nthe open plains of Sacae.$k$pOh my! Pay me no mind. But,\nplease, know that I'm always\nhere for you, all right?
MID_LIN_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_LIN_VOICE02: やぁっ！

MID_LIN_VOICE11: Need me, friend?
MID_LIN_VOICE12: Some people might need to be prodded into action. Not me.
MID_LIN_VOICE13: Glad to talk. It's nice to get what's on our minds out there in the open.
MID_LIN_VOICE14: I'm always up early, so don't be surprised if I barge in and ask, "Are you awake yet?"
MID_LIN_VOICE15: I grew up on the plains, so I'm pretty direct. Still, I have manners. Just not...etiquette.
MID_LIN_VOICE16: How I long to be on the open plains. The feeling of the wind...
MID_LIN_VOICE17: I'll protect you no matter what. Just stick close to me.
MID_LIN_VOICE18: Got it.
MID_LIN_VOICE19: Orders?
MID_LIN_VOICE20: Let's go.
