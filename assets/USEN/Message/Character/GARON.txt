MID_GARON_HOME1: Many expect that a king will bring\npeace with his rule. Not I. I bring\nannihilation.
MID_GARON_HOME2: The Kingdom of Nohr and the\nKingdom of Hoshido... All of it\nwill be mine, as Anankos decreed.
MID_GARON_HOME3: You! You're in my way. Cease your\nloitering. You are a mere tactician—do\nnot think yourself above your station.
MID_GARON_HOME4: What is your objective? You will join\ntogether with me, and we will crush\nour foes. That is our fate.
MID_GARON_HOME5: Burn it all until even the ashes are\nno more... In time, even this world\nwill be consumed by destruction.
MID_GARON_FRIEND: So you are $Nu.\nI am King Garon of Nohr.
MID_GARON_LEVEL1: It will be I, Garon, who rules Nohr and\nHoshido as king—for all eternity!
MID_GARON_LEVEL2: Bwahaha! This... It comes to me, as is\nright...
MID_GARON_LEVEL3: What...is...this...
MID_GARON_SKILL: Hahaha! Good! One step closer to\nfulfilling my ambitions...
MID_GARON_JOIN: I am Garon, King of Nohr. A little\nworm like you, trying to take the\nmeasure of me? A futile effort!
MID_GARON_STRONGEST: There is a difference between you\nand the preening and posturing\nfools here, $Nu...$k$pYou seem to have purpose.$k$pHehehe... Do not misunderstand me.\nDo not expect praise! Your life has\nno worth to it. No one's does! $k$pI am no exception. Devote yourself to\nyour land, your people, your wife,\nyour children... They will all vanish.$k$pHehe...bwahaha! Do you understand?\nEverything...will be gone one day.$k$pTogether, all will perish. It is the will\nof Anankos, and I understand it\nacutely...
MID_GARON_VOICE01: ふんっ！
MID_GARON_VOICE02: むぅん！
MID_GARON_VOICE03: ぬおおっ！
MID_GARON_VOICE04: 馬鹿な…！
MID_GARON_VOICE05: Vanish into the darkness!
MID_GARON_VOICE06: I relish this chance.
MID_GARON_VOICE07: You can't possibly win!
MID_GARON_VOICE08: You are no match for me!
MID_GARON_VOICE09: I refuse to accept...
MID_GARON_VOICE10: ふはははっ！
MID_GARON_VOICE11: What business have you with Garon, the King of Nohr?
MID_GARON_VOICE12: We of the royal family are descendants of the ancient gods, the First Dragons.
MID_GARON_VOICE13: As the inheritor of divine strength, I conquer those who oppose me with ease.
MID_GARON_VOICE14: Corrin... I should have killed you when I had the chance.
MID_GARON_VOICE15: There should be no path that results in my defeat. Not the King of Nohr...
MID_GARON_VOICE16: To long for defeat at the hands of my own child... Inconceivable.
MID_GARON_VOICE17: This feeling... It is not unfamiliar. How long has it been since I felt this way?
MID_GARON_VOICE18: Come to me.
MID_GARON_VOICE19: Oh, yes.
MID_GARON_VOICE20: Well, well...
