MID_SENERIO_HOME1: The Order of Heroes doesn't fight for\nmoney—or even merely for honor.\nOnly to save people.$k$pVery odd. I can't even begin to\nrelate to that kind of thinking.
MID_SENERIO_HOME2: You're curious...about my world?\nTell me how it would benefit me to\nshare those details with you?
MID_SENERIO_HOME3: If your tactics fail, it's us that fall on\nthe battlefield. Not you. So please\nask if you need tactical advice.
MID_SENERIO_HOME4: Not that's it's anyone's business,\nbut in my world, I'm among those\ncalled the Branded.$k$pThat means I was condemned\nmore or less at birth to be hated\nand shunned. So, there it is.
MID_SENERIO_HOME5: I've been scouring the history\nbooks of this world. Oh, I have\nscant interest in history itself.$k$pI am only searching for any\ninformation that will prove useful\nto guide our tactics here.
MID_SENERIO_FRIEND: I've come to deliver greetings from\n$Nf.$k$pNow I'll be on my way.
MID_SENERIO_LEVEL1: Fortune twists in the wind, and\ntoday it blows my way.
MID_SENERIO_LEVEL2: Any increase to my abilities\nis most welcome.
MID_SENERIO_LEVEL3: Fortune twists in the wind, and\ntoday it blows elsewhere.
MID_SENERIO_SKILL: Now, may increasing my strength\nwork to your advantage.
MID_SENERIO_JOIN: Hmm. My name? I am the mage\nSoren. Now, I have a question\nfor you. Is Ike here?
MID_SENERIO_STRONGEST: ...and yes, that concludes my\nanalysis of the abilities of Heroes\nfrom other worlds.$k$pAs you can now fully understand,\nthey would make dangerous foes\nif they weren't our allies.$k$pAnd furthermore... Excuse me?\nI sense your attention drifting\naway, $Nu.$k$pFor goodness sake, you are\nsometimes so vexing to me that\nI can hardly—$k$pOh, never mind. But you shouldn't\nget the wrong idea.$k$pI don't care a whit about anything\nbut getting back home. Being here\nis only temporary for me.$k$pOh, you wonder why I haven't\nleft of my own accord then?!\nIt's because you...you...$k$pI mean, it's because staying lets\nme sneak into other worlds and\nlearn our enemies' secrets.$k$pThat's useful to me. But if I can\ncontinue to be useful to you...?$k$pThen I am happy to say that we\ncan consider it mutually\nbeneficial.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE01: はっ！
MID_SENERIO_VOICE02: Pointless
MID_SENERIO_VOICE03: うああっ！
MID_SENERIO_VOICE04: I miscalculated...
MID_SENERIO_VOICE05: Are you ready to die?
MID_SENERIO_VOICE06: I dispose of my enemies.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE07: Out of my way.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE08: Are we done here?
MID_SENERIO_VOICE09: No...
MID_SENERIO_VOICE10: Hmp
MID_SENERIO_VOICE11: You're the tactician for this group? Oh, no... It's nothing.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE12: I'll take my leave unless you have a specific request of me.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE13: I am a mercenary. Guided by self-interest. Above bonds and attachments.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE14: Ike is much more than a leader. No one could compare to him.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE15: When Ike isn't feeling well, most would never notice that his left eye twitches.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE16: No matter who I may be...I have a duty.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE17: Helping you is to our mutual advantage. That is all.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE18: OK.
MID_SENERIO_VOICE19: Let's see...
MID_SENERIO_VOICE20: Very well.
