MID_THANY_STRONGEST: Some people say I'm childish.\nNot nice to say, but maybe not\ntotally wrong either.$k$pBut since I've come here and\nfought alongside everyone, I feel\nlike I've grown up a lot!$k$pHey, and here you are, I bet,\nthinking that ol' Shanna looks\njust the same, right?$k$pHow do I know? Oh, I know.\nEveryone always looks at me\nlike I'm just the same.$k$pLooky there—it's Shanna!\nAnd there—it's Shanna!$k$pThe thing is, I like being me.\nSo I wouldn't mind putting off\nthis whole growing-up thing.$k$pThat is, if you don't mind. Ha!\nI knew you wouldn't!
