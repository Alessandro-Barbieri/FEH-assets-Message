MID_HARDIN_DARK01_HOME1: It seems human greed and\nwarmongering are traits that persist\nacross many worlds. Fascinating...$k$pLet me see just what the power of\nyour many Heroes can achieve.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_HOME2: Parading this prince of light as some\ndevoted patriot knight... Nothing but a\ngrand deception.$k$pIt will not feed the citizens. If a country\nis weak, its future holds only decay\nand inevitable collapse.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_HOME3: Uncommon though your strength\nmay be, it is no match for the\nDarksphere I hold.$k$pDo not forget your place.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_HOME4: It is my duty to elevate individuals\nwho demonstrate greatness.$k$pIf you do so, I will gladly welcome you\ninto the Archanean Imperial Army.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_HOME5: I feel as if I've freshly awoken from a\nnightmare... Yet I long for battle still.\nThe spirit of the Coyote lives on.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_FRIEND: You're gathering Heroes from across\nmany countries? Surely you don't\nintend on defying my army with them.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_LEVEL1: The strong are rightfully\nrewarded!
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_LEVEL2: Some enemies remain. Ready\nthe army for our next strike!
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_LEVEL3: It seems the shine of my weapon\nhas been dimmed...
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_SKILL: Preparations are complete. Now,\neradicate the enemy!
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_JOIN: My name is Hardin, Emperor of the\nHoly Empire of Archanea.$k$pIf you do not wish to be scarred by my\nfury, you will give me your name in\nreturn.
MID_HARDIN_DARK01_STRONGEST: There are countless kings and even\nmore nobles in the world, but most\nlack the power to back up their status.$k$pMost of them simply rot in the mud of\ntheir privilege.$k$pThese fools invite war to their\ndoorsteps and then send their own\ncitizens off to die.$k$pWhat point is there for such a country\nto exist? Perhaps it would be best for\nsuch places to be destroyed outright.$k$pThis very world included...$k$pHowever, through the fog of war I saw\na light. Archanea's true treasure...\nI swore on my sword to protect her.$k$pIt was that purpose which showed me\nthat the country—the world—needed\nto be cleansed.$k$pI needed to exile the fools and kill all\nwho opposed me.$k$pEven if that meant cutting down\nsomeone entrusted with the Fire\nEmblem itself.$k$pPardon me, what... What was I saying\njust now? Right... I must annihilate\nthe rebels. Ready the army!
