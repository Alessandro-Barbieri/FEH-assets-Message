MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_HOME1: Princess Sharena started chatting\nwith me while I was in the middle of\nmy "normal practice."$k$pShe grew quite fond of me in that\ntime, so now I'm not sure when I\ncan stop acting like that...
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_HOME2: Robin once said I should act more\nnormal, so today I'm putting my\n"normal practice" to use. Huzzah!
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_HOME3: Am I chilly in this outfit? How sweet of\nyou to be concerned for my welfare!\nBut I'm fine.$k$pTo be honest...it's usually other\npeople who get the chills around\nme. Oh-ho-ho...
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_HOME4: Would you be so kind as to escort me\nto a shop here in Askr, huzzah? I\nmust buy a "gift" for my dear Robin.
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_HOME5: Oh-ho, you think my outfit is cute?\nStare too long, and...$k$pI'll burn you with this candle.
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_FRIEND: Oh-ho and huzzah! I've brought you\na festive greeting from your friend\n$Nf!
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_LEVEL1: Gracious, look how I've grown!\nIt had better not be a curse...
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_LEVEL2: Huzzah! Aren't you proud of my\nhard work?
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_LEVEL3: What is the meaning of this?
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_SKILL: New power? Huzzah, and... Um...\nSomething...normal-sounding?
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_JOIN: Oh-ho and huzzah! I'm Tharja, just a\ntypically normally plain girl! Have a\nhappy winter festival!$k$pDo you think Robin heard me\nbeing normal?
MID_SALLYA_WINTER01_STRONGEST: Why good day,\n$Nu! How fare\nyou? Enjoying the weather?$k$pHuzzah, I baked you a pie! I do so\nadore baking. It's even topped with a\nblood-colored—er, red—berry sauce.$k$pIt's a special gift just for Y-O-U, for\ntaking such good care of me.$k$pGive me just a moment to slash it—\nI mean, slice it—into ribbons—I\nmean, into pieces...$k$pOh-ho-ho, what a lovely and deep\ncut! Doesn't the oozing sauce remind\nyou of a beautiful curse?$k$pOh, er... I mean... Huzzah, or... Hm.\nI seem to have forgotten my "normal\npractice."$k$pWell, I guess it's no use pretending\nanymore. This is the real me: a hex-\nloving, curse-slinging witch.$k$pI take it you're disappointed?$k$pYou're not disappointed at all? Well,\nthank you. You're...surprisingly kind...$k$pI suppose it's OK to celebrate the\nwinter festival as my true self...\nJust because it's with you.
