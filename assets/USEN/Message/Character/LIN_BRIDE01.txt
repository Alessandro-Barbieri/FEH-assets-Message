MID_LIN_BRIDE01_HOME1: My ideal match? I haven't given it\nmuch thought... If I had to say, it\nwould be someone I love, of course.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_HOME2: This outfit is so embarrassing. Are\nwomen usually OK with getting\nmarried in a getup like this?
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_HOME3: Feeling tired? Let me know if I can do\nanything, $Nu.$k$pI know I'm not exactly the relaxed\ntype, but...
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_HOME4: Think this dress is going to keep me\noff the battlefield? Think again!\nI'm as fierce a fighter as I ever was—$k$pYeah, I can see that you get it.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_HOME5: Ugh... This dress is so restrictive!\nHey, don't look at me! I didn't pick\nit out.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_FRIEND: This dress? Don't ask! Forget you\nsaw anything! Oh, right. Hi from\n$Nf!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_LEVEL1: Wow, I'm doing great! Maybe I'll\nkeep wearing this thing...
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_LEVEL2: Never thought much about being\na bride, but I did train for battle!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_LEVEL3: I can't concentrate when\nI'm dressed like this!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_SKILL: Look! With this power, I can—\nActually, don't look. This dress...\n
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_JOIN: My name is Lyn, and I swear there's\na reason I'm in this getup, but...\nLet's not focus on the dress, OK?
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_STRONGEST: Oh, sorry. I was staring at you. You\njust remind me of someone I know,\n$Nu.$k$pMy husband? You're kidding, right?$k$pNo, another tactician. We helped\neach other out, and we traveled a\nlong way together...$k$pThat friendship means a lot to me.$k$pI'm not sure if you're that much alike,\nbut spending time with you does\nmake me happy.$k$pIf you feel the same, I hope we're\nnever separated...$k$pThat sounds like a proposal? Of\ncourse it isn't! Why would you even\nthink that?
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE01: はいっ！
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE02: よいしょ
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE03: いやぁっ！
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE04: Nooo!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE05: Seriously?
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE06: This dress wasn't my idea!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE07: I want my sword back!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE08: What are you looking at?!
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE09: Not like this...
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE10: Heehee
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE11: I'll protect you.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE12: Always at your side.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE13: I know. I know. I know! This really doesn't suit me.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE14: This dress will be the end of me.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE15: I hope you don't find this whole thing funny.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE16: I wonder if my grandfather would be happy to see me like this...
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE17: I would never marry someone who couldn't stand at my side in battle. Hey! Let's spar.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE18: All right.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE19: Here we go.
MID_LIN_BRIDE01_VOICE20: Try my best.
