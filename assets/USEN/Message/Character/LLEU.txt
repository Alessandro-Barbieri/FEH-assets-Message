MID_LLEU_HOME1: I will master the dark arts, even if I\nmust destroy a world or three to\ndo it. What? I'm being serious!
MID_LLEU_HOME2: You can't do anything without power,\nincluding...protect those whom you\nmust protect.$k$pSo that's why I must master the\ndark arts at any cost.
MID_LLEU_HOME3: I keep my distance because I need to.\nI've got a lot on my mind. And that\nmeans I need to be alone...a lot.
MID_LLEU_HOME4: Not like I noticed...but you should\nrest sometimes. These patrols of\nyours are going to burn you out.$k$pAnd then I'll have to do more work.
MID_LLEU_HOME5: Well, don't you have a spring in\nyour step? I have to admit, I find that\npretty...well, irritating.$k$pBut that's just me. You go right on\nahead. Maybe it'll rub off.

MID_LLEU_SKILL: What use are thanks? Instead, I'll\nshow you what power can do.
MID_LLEU_JOIN: I am trying to learn the deepest\nsecrets of the dark arts. But if you\nmust know...the name's Raigh.
MID_LLEU_STRONGEST: Sheesh. You just can't help poking\nyour nose in my business, can you?\nWell, fine.$k$pThing is, maybe since you did keep\nprodding me, I might have gotten\nbetter than I would have otherwise.$k$pHey, I said maybe. That's all.$k$pI know you only spent time with me\nbecause you feel sorry for...\nwell, whatever has me twisted up.$k$pRight? You don't need to admit it.\nBesides, I'm the one who got\nthe short end of the stick here.$k$pNow that I'm stuck with you,\nI have one more person I need\nto look out for! So, uh, thanks.
