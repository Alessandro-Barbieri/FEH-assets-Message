MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_HOME1: My mother was a noble, but she fell in\nlove with a man from the plains, and\nthey eloped.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_HOME2: My father was chieftain of the Lorca\ntribe. I wanted to protect our people in\nhis stead, but...now I'm the last of us.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_HOME3: Allow me to take over some of your\nresponsibilities so you can get some\nextra sleep.$k$pWhen morning comes, I'll make sure\nyou wake up on time.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_HOME4: This is Mulagir, the bow of swift\nwind, and one of the legendary\nweapons.$k$pI hear it was once wielded by a\nwoman named Hanon.\n
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_HOME5: To train one's sight upon a moving\ntarget from atop a galloping horse\nand then strike with perfect accuracy.$k$pCommon practice for people of the\nplains.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_FRIEND: Greetings from\n$Nf. I hope\nyou'll continue—$k$pOh? Excuse me if my manners seem\na bit off...
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_LEVEL1: Father, Mother... Watch over me.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_LEVEL2: It's as if this bow is guiding me...
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_LEVEL3: I must be careful to remain atop\nmy horse.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_SKILL: Thank you. I'll do my best to live\nup to your expectations.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_JOIN: My name is Lyndis. Allow me to put\nthis legendary Sacaen bow to use by\nassisting you.
MID_LIN_POPULARITY01_STRONGEST: Two types of blood run through my\nveins: that of a noble household, and\nthat of the Sacaen Plains.$k$pI hold these two sides in equal\nimportance. This heritage is what\nmakes me who I am, but moreover...$k$pIt allows me to feel as though my\nfather and mother look after me still.$k$pAnd should I someday be wed and\nhave children of my own, I'll watch\nover them in turn.$k$pHm... That's a strange thing to think\nabout at a time like this, isn't it? I\ncould die tomorrow, after all.$k$pBut maybe that's why I think about\nsuch things. Someone to carry on my\nparents' bloodline...$k$pAnd their happiness.
