MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_HOME1: Warrior priestesses of old once wore\noutfits just like this.$k$pAppropriate garb when locked in a\nbattle for the fate of the world, don't\nyou think?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_HOME2: I hope that the world can one day\nfind peace and that those precious to\nme remain safe...$k$pThat's my prayer to Mila.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_HOME3: Alm entrusted me with this sword.\nEver since childhood, he's been\nextremely kind...as well as brave.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_HOME4: I sensed someone calling out to me.\nNo, not just one person...but many.\nWhat could that mean?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_HOME5: Prayer and reflection are important,\nbut as a warrior priestess I must keep\nup my sword training as well.$k$pI wonder if someone here would be\nwilling to play the role of opponent...
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_FRIEND: I've come to check up on you in\nplace of $Nf.$k$pAre you getting along as usual?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_LEVEL1: Such strength would be impossible\nwithout everyone's support.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_LEVEL2: There's nothing wrong with steady\nprogress. Don't you agree?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_LEVEL3: Oh, how unfortunate... I must have\nlost my usual stride.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_SKILL: Thank you so much. Your trust in me\nshall be rewarded.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_JOIN: I am Celica, a warrior priestess in\nservice to the goddess Mila. I heard a\nvoice calling out to me... Was it you?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_STRONGEST: It may be odd for a warrior priestess\nto admit this, but...I do not enjoy\nfighting.$k$pIf it were up to me, I would never\nhurt another living soul.$k$pHowever, if something or someone\nimportant to me needs defending, I\nhave no choice but to fight.$k$pI must sound like such a hypocrite...\nDo you think poorly of me?$k$pYou say I'm a truly kind person?\nN-no, I disagree... Not long ago, I\nangered someone very close to me.$k$pHis only wrongdoing was casting his\nown safety aside so he could fight for\nhis full convictions without hesitation.$k$pIn fact, you remind me of him... Just a\nlittle. Perhaps that's why I'm willing\nto fight to protect you.$k$pIf I stay by your side...then I'm sure\nmy reasons for fighting will become\nclear.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE01: Ha!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE02: With this blow...!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE03: Ugh!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE04: No...!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE05: Place your trust in me!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE06: Your feelings give me strength!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE07: By Mila's grace!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE08: Guide my hand!
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE09: No... Alm...
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE10: Uhmm...
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE11: Warrior priestesses of old wore outfits just like this. Do you think it suits me?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE12: Oh! You startled me. You like playing tricks, huh? The truth is...I do, too.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE13: In order to protect Mila, a warrior priestess must be adept with both magic and the sword.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE14: This sword is a curious one. It can be wielded by royalty alone.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE15: No matter the distance between us, it feels like Alm is right by my side.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE16: Oh, Alm... No matter where I am, I always find myself thinking of you. Are you thinking of me?
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE17: You are this world's hope. By protecting you, I'll help keep the darkness at bay.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE18: We're all right.
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE19: Hmm...
MID_CELLICA_POPULARITY03_VOICE20: I'll clear a path.
