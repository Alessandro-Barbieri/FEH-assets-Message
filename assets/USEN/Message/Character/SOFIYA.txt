MID_SOFIYA_HOME1: Castles and towns... And so many\npeople... My, it's all so...different\nfrom what I'm used to!
MID_SOFIYA_HOME2: I was raised to...avoid...\noutsiders.
MID_SOFIYA_HOME3: I am half human, half dragon...\nBut why should halves...divide us?\nMy halves make me...whole.
MID_SOFIYA_HOME4: How I long for my village. And\nmost of all...the oasis there.\nThe waters, so pure!
MID_SOFIYA_HOME5: I have been...outside on rare\noccasion. Everyone can seem so\nodd to me.$k$pFor instance, some arrows are\ncalled...quarrels. Isn't that\nstrange?
MID_SOFIYA_FRIEND: You there... You must be...\n$Nu?$k$pI have seen...your future.
MID_SOFIYA_LEVEL1: I foresaw that...today would\nbe a good day.

MID_SOFIYA_SKILL: This—! And my dragon blood—!\nSo light-headed...
MID_SOFIYA_JOIN: I am...Sophia. I am...? Forgive me—\nI get winded. I am a priestess from\nthe Nabata Desert.
MID_SOFIYA_STRONGEST: Your future...has shifted and\nswirled since we met.$k$pAt first, your future was a fog\nthat not even my eyes could\npierce.$k$pOver time, I made out the faintest\nnimbus around you. A weak\nglow, if you will.$k$pThat glow has grown, illumined\nby light—many lights, from\nmany sources!$k$pThese have mystified me until\nrecently, when I realized that\nI...am one of those lights.$k$pYou invite such lights to you,\nand your glow is becoming like a\nbeacon, banishing the fog!$k$pAnd so...I want to stay with you\nto see what your future will look\nlike when the fog...is gone.
