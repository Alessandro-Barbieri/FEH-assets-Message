MID_MARIABELL_HOME1: Sharena is quite good humored, don't\nyou agree? Perhaps I'll invite her and\nLissa both for tea...
MID_MARIABELL_HOME2: I'm with a group known as the\nShepherds. A noblewoman such as\nmyself must help preserve the peace.
MID_MARIABELL_HOME3: You always seem so busy. Please,\nleave the patrols to me.$k$pI shall deliver a sound thrashing to\nany unsavory individuals I should\nhappen across.
MID_MARIABELL_HOME4: Awright then, pet? Everythin' luvverly\njubberly, ain't it?$k$pWhy are you giving me that ghastly\nlook? I was merely practicing slang\nused by commoners in my homeland.
MID_MARIABELL_HOME5: Of course studying is expected of a\nnoblewoman, but I do it so I can fulfill\nmy dream of becoming a magistrate.
MID_MARIABELL_FRIEND: Stand up straight! I've come all this\nway with a gift from your friend\n$Nf.$k$pThe very least you could do is look\npresentable when you accept it.
MID_MARIABELL_LEVEL1: One step closer and I'll be forced\nto maim you.
MID_MARIABELL_LEVEL2: Results such as these are rather easy\nfor me to come by.
MID_MARIABELL_LEVEL3: This is completely unacceptable.
MID_MARIABELL_SKILL: I'll perform even more brilliantly\nfrom now on.
MID_MARIABELL_JOIN: I am Maribelle, of the Shepherds.\nI will lend you my aid if you so desire.
MID_MARIABELL_STRONGEST: Goodness me, that slack posture of\nyours simply will not do. Aren't you\nsome sort of great hero in this world?$k$pThen you should carry yourself\naccordingly.$k$pYou must straighten your neck like\nso, and puff out your chest with\npride. No, no, that is ALL wrong!$k$pImagine yourself bound tightly to a\nrod that keeps you stiff from head\nto toe.$k$pWell! I see you can do it if you truly\napply yourself. I suppose you have a\ndecent base to work from...$k$pEven just a tiny improvement can\nmake a world of difference.$k$pAs a noblewoman, I do not care to\nfollow anyone who lacks the proper\ndecorum. You, however...$k$pEven as you are now, I would follow\nyou to the end.$k$pNow, let us have a small break and\npartake of some tea, shall we? I use\nonly the highest quality herbs.$k$pAnd since you did so well with your\nposture, I won't even scold you for\nyour dreadful tea-drinking manners!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE01: はいっ！
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE02: それっ！
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE03: きゃあ！
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE04: なんと野蛮な…！
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE05: Big mistake.
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE06: I will RUIN you!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE07: I'm afraid you're dead meat.
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE08: You have angered me. C'mere!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE09: You brute.
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE10: うふふ
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE11: Mind how you play!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE12: I want you at your very best!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE13: Tell me, is Lissa here? She's a dear friend of mine.
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE14: You touched me! Without saying a thing! Do people in your world consider that some sort of greeting?
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE15: Your summoning skills are so valuable. I have to admit—they're very impressive!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE16: Hmm. Perhaps a tea party is just the thing!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE17: If you have a sincere desire to improve your bearing, I'll take it on myself to instruct you.
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE18: Yes.
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE19: Onward!
MID_MARIABELL_VOICE20: I'll do it!
