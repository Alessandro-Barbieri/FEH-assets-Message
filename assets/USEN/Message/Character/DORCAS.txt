MID_DORCAS_HOME1: Feels like it's been an age since my\nmercenary days in Bern. I hope\nNatalie is faring well without me...
MID_DORCAS_HOME2: Back when I was a mercenary, I met\na girl named Lyn. She put things into\nperspective for me.$k$pAnd now, here I am...
MID_DORCAS_HOME3: You're looking a bit pale. A good\nwarrior knows when to take a break.\nGo sit down for a spell.
MID_DORCAS_HOME4: You want to hear about my wife?\nWell, I can't say I have many\ninteresting tales, but... All right.
MID_DORCAS_HOME5: Between training sessions, I like to\nlook at this picture Natalie drew for\nme. It's a self-portrait.
MID_DORCAS_FRIEND: You're $Nu?\nI'm counting on you to look after\n$Nf.
MID_DORCAS_LEVEL1: I can't help but worry whenever I\nstart feeling this good.
MID_DORCAS_LEVEL2: Seems fine.
MID_DORCAS_LEVEL3: I need to do better. For Natalie.
MID_DORCAS_SKILL: Still can't believe this is all\nreally happening.
MID_DORCAS_JOIN: The name's Dorcas. I used to fight as\na mercenary in Bern, but... Well,\nthat's all in the past now.
MID_DORCAS_STRONGEST: I became a mercenary to earn money\nfor my wife's medicine. The job took\nme off the straight and narrow.$k$pBut then I met Lyn and the others...\nThey set me straight. Helped me see\nthings clearly again.$k$pI want to do right by them for all\nthey've done for Natalie and me.$k$pI know you're all fighting for a good\ncause, just like Lyn... And I don't plan\non making the same mistake twice.$k$pI hope you'll let me continue fighting\nby your side for as long as I can.
